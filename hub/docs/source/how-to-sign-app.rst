Sign Hub Apps
=============

This guide explains how app signing works in Flower Hub and how to use it in practice.

Before an app can be reviewed and signed, it must already be published to Flower Hub.
The app does not need to be published by the same account that reviews/signs it.


How App Signing Works
---------------------

At a high level:

1. An app exists on Hub (your own app or someone else's app).
2. The reviewer has an Ed25519 key pair and has registered the public key in their
   Flower account profile.
3. A reviewer downloads the FAB and signs it with the matching Ed25519 private key via
   :code:`flwr app review`.
4. The signature is attached to app verification metadata in the platform.
5. Users can inspect the app's verification metadata on the app page and decide which
   signers they trust.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Flower CLI installed
- A Flower account and active login
- An Ed25519 OpenSSH key pair for signing
- The corresponding public key added to your Flower account profile
- An app on Flower Hub to review/sign

Log in:

.. code-block:: bash

    flwr login


Create a Signing Key
--------------------

Generate an Ed25519 key pair in OpenSSH format:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f hub_signing_key -C "hub-review-key"

This creates:

- :code:`hub_signing_key` (private key, keep secret)
- :code:`hub_signing_key.pub` (public key)

.. warning::

   Keep private keys secure. Anyone with this private key can produce signatures
   attributed to that signer.


Register Your Public Key in Flower Account
------------------------------------------

Add the public key to your Flower account profile:

- Open :code:`https://flower.ai/profile/<account_username>/`
- Add the content of :code:`hub_signing_key.pub` to your profile keys

When signing, you must use the private key corresponding to a public key registered in
the reviewer account.


Choose an App to Sign
---------------------

You can sign:

- your own app, or
- an app published by someone else.

Supported app specs:

- :code:`@account/app` (latest version)
- :code:`@account/app==x.y.z` (specific version)

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Sign latest version
    flwr app review @myorg/myapp

    # Sign a specific version
    flwr app review @myorg/myapp==1.2.0


Review and Sign the App
-----------------------

Sign an app version:

.. code-block:: bash

    flwr app review @account/app==x.y.z

The CLI will:

1. Download the FAB.
2. Unpack it for manual inspection.
3. Ask you to type :code:`SIGN`.
4. Ask for the path to your Ed25519 OpenSSH private key.
5. Submit the signature to Flower Platform.

.. note::

   :code:`flwr app review` signs the FAB digest plus timestamp. The resulting
   signature is submitted with app id and version.


Check Verifications on the App Page
-----------------------------------

If you want to run an app and evaluate trust, open the app page on Flower Hub and check
the :code:`Verifications` section.

Use this section to see who signed the app and decide whether you trust those signers.


Troubleshooting
---------------

- Private key errors in review:
  ensure the key is an Ed25519 OpenSSH private key.
- Signature not shown on app page:
  confirm you completed :code:`flwr app review` and submitted with a private key that
  matches a public key registered in your Flower account profile.
