****Abstract:**** In federated learning, a large number of users collaborate to learn a global model. They alternate local computations and communication with a distant server. Communication, which can be slow and costly, is the main bottleneck in this setting. In addition to communication-efficiency, a robust algorithm should allow for partial participation, the desirable feature that not all clients need to participate to every round of the training process. To reduce the communication load and therefore accelerate distributed gradient descent, two strategies are popular: 1) communicate less frequently; that is, perform several iterations of local computations between the communication rounds; and 2) communicate compressed information instead of full-dimensional vectors. We propose TAMUNA, the first algorithm for distributed optimization and federated learning, which harnesses these two strategies jointly and allows for partial participation. TAMUNA converges linearly to an exact solution in the strongly convex setting, with a doubly accelerated rate: it provably benefits from the two acceleration mechanisms provided by local training and compression, namely a better dependency on the condition number of the functions and on the model dimension, respectively.


## About this baseline

****What’s implemented:**** The code in this directory compares Tamuna with FedAvg. It produces three plots comparing loss, accuracy and communication complexity of the two algorithms. 

****Datasets:**** MNIST

****Hardware Setup:**** By default, the experiments expect at least one gpu, but this can be changed to cpu only by specifying client and server devices. Default setup less than 5 GB of dedicated GPU memory.

****Dataset:**** By default, training split of MNIST dataset is divided in iid fashion across all 1000 clients, while test split stays on the server for centralized evaluation. Training dataset can also be divided using power law by setting `dataset.iid` to `False` in `base.yaml` config.

## Environment Setup

This requires `pyenv` and `poetry` already installed.

```bash
# set local python version via pyenv
pyenv local 3.10.6
# then fix that for poetry
poetry env use 3.10.6
# then install poetry env
poetry install
```


## Running the Experiments

Default experimental setup in defined in `conf/base.yaml`, this can be changed if needed.

```bash
poetry run python -m tamuna.main
```

Running time for default experimental setup is around 13min on Intel Core i5-12400F and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, 
while the CPU-only version, which can be found in `conf/base-cpu.yaml`, takes around 20min.


## Expected Results

The resulting directory in `./outputs/` should contain (among other things) `communication_complexity.png` and `loss_accuracy.png`.
