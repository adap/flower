> [!IMPORTANT]
> To help having all baselines similarly formatted and structured, we have included two scripts in `baselines/dev` that when run will format your code and run some tests checking if it's formatted.
> These checks use standard packages such as `isort`, `black`, `pylint` and others. You as a baseline creator will need to install additional pacakges. These are already specified in the `pyproject.toml` of
> your baseline. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a python env
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.14 fedlc

# Activate it
pyenv activate fedlc

# Install project including developer packages
# Note the `-e` this means you install it in editable mode
# so even if you change the code you don't need to do `pip install`
# again. However, if you add a new dependency to `pyproject.toml` you
# will need to re-run the command below
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Even without modifying or adding new code, you can run your baseline
# with the placeholder code generated when you did `flwr new`. If you
# want to test this to familiarise yourself with how flower apps are
# executed, execute this from the directory where you `pyproject.toml` is:
flwr run .

# At anypoint during the process of creating your baseline you can
# run the formatting script. For this do:
cd .. # so you are in the `flower/baselines` directory

# Run the formatting script (it will auto-correct issues if possible)
./dev/format-baseline.sh fedlc

# Then, if the above is all good, run the tests.
./dev/test-baseline.sh fedlc
```

**Paper:** https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhang22p

**Authors:** Jie Zhang, Zhiqi Li, Bo Li, Jianghe Xu, Shuang Wu, Shouhong Ding, Chao Wu

**Abstract:** Traditional federated optimization methods perform poorly with heterogeneous data (i.e. , accuracy reduction), especially for highly skewed data. In this paper, we investigate the label distribution skew in FL, where the distribution of labels varies across clients. First, we investigate the label distribution skew from a statistical view. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that previous methods based on softmax cross-entropy are not suitable, which can result in local models heavily overfitting to minority classes and missing classes. Additionally, we theoretically introduce a deviation bound to measure the deviation of the gradient after local update. At last, we propose FedLC (\textbf{Fed}erated learning via \textbf{L}ogits \textbf{C}alibration), which calibrates the logits before softmax cross-entropy according to the probability of occurrence of each class. FedLC applies a fine-grained calibrated cross-entropy loss to local update by adding a pairwise label margin. Extensive experiments on federated datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate that FedLC leads to a more accurate global model and much improved performance. Furthermore, integrating other FL methods into our approach can further enhance the performance of the global model.

## About this baseline

**Whatâ€™s implemented:** This repo contains an implementation for FedLC (Federated Learning with Logits Correction) introduced by the paper. It also contains code to replicate results from Table 1 and Table 2:

| Dataset  | Partitioning Method | Skewness | Methods |
| :------- | :------: | :------: | :-----------------: |
| CIFAR-10 | Dirichlet  |  dirichlet alpha = 0.05 | FedAvg, FedProx, FedRS, FedLC  |
| CIFAR-10 | Shard-based  | num shards per partition =2 |  FedAvg, FedProx, FedRS, FedLC  |

**Datasets:** CIFAR10

**Hardware Setup:** The paper uses 8x V100 GPU set up. However, due to resource constraints, the experiments were run with ___ GPU. FedLC on CIFAR10 with 20 clients and 400 rounds.

**Contributors:** [@flydump](https://github.com/flydump)

## Experimental Setup

**Task:** Image classification

**Model:** Custom CNN model consisting of 3 CNN layers(with max pooling) and 1 fully connected layer (described in Table 9 in the Appendix of paper)

**Dataset:** The implementation currently only supports CIFAR-10 dataset. The paper considers both distribution-based and quantity-based label skew. Depending on the arguments passed to `--skew-type`, the dataset is partitioned differently. If using `--skew-type distribution` (default), the dataset is partitioned using the [DirichletPartitioner](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/ref-api/flwr_datasets.partitioner.DirichletPartitioner.html). If `--skew-type quantity` is used, the [ShardPartitioner](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/ref-api/flwr_datasets.partitioner.ShardPartitioner.html) is used, which sorts the dataset by labels and creates shards, and randomly allocates shards to each client (the number of which depends on the `--num-shards-per-partition` arg) 

| Dataset  |  Num classes | Num clients | Partitioning method |
| :------- | :------: | :------: | :-----------------: |
| CIFAR-10 |    10    |  10  |   Non-IID (Dirichlet and Shard-based)  |

**Training Hyperparameters:** Table below shows the **default** training hyperparams for the experiments. Values are from the original paper where provided. The main hyper-parameter of FedLC is tau which determines the logit calibration strength (refer to Equation 7 of the paper). While this value isn't specified in the paper, I used the default value used in other public implementations of FedLC (see [1](https://github.com/bytedance/feddecorr) and [2](https://github.com/KarhouTam/FL-bench) )

| Description | Default Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| tau (logit calibration strength) | 0.5 |
| local epochs | 1 |
| learning rate | 0.01 |
| number of rounds | 400 |
| batch size | 128 |
| proximal mu (only used if alg=fedprox) | 0.0 |
