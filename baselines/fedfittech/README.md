# FedFitTech: A Baseline in Federated Learning for Fitness Tracking

<p align="justify">  This repository introduces FedFitTech, which is a Federated Learning baseline specifically designed for Fitness Technology (FitTech) using the Flower framework, enabling reproducible experiments and benchmarking. As an example usage of FedFitTech, we also included a case study that incorporates a client-side early stopping strategy.  </p>

**Abstract:** <p align="justify">  Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness devices. Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices continuously capture physical movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with data privacy concerns, regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast, Federated Learning enables a decentralized model training by communicating model updates (see Fig. 1) rather than potentially private wearable sensor data. Applying Federated Learning to FitTech presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization and generalization. To research this, we present FedFitTech, a Flower framework that can be used as a baseline for Federated Learning in FitTech. As a case study that illustrates its usage, we designed a system with FedFitTech that incorporates a client-side early stopping strategy. This system empowers wearable devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of fitness tracking applications. Empirical results demonstrate that this early stopping strategy has shown to reduce overall redundant communications by 13%, while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible recognition cost by 1%.   </p>

  <em>Figure 1: In FedFitTech, wearable fitness devices locally train a global classification model for fitness activities (green model) shared by a server. Tuned local models (blue models) are shared with the server for aggregation to update a global model across all participants. This global model is then redistributed for further training rounds, leading to a private system that benefits from external patterns.</em>

## 1. About this baseline

**1.1 What's implemented:** <p align="justify">  The code in this directory provides the FedFitTech baseline, enables reproducible experiments and benchmarking of Fitness Tracking in the Federated Learning setting, as well as a case study of FedFitTech. </p>


**1.2 Dataset:** <p align="justify"> The [WEAR](https://mariusbock.github.io/wear/) (Wearable and Egocentric Activity Recognition) dataset includes 22 participants, 24 subjects, 18 activities + NULL class. The activities are grouped into three categories: 

* Jogging (5 activities: normal, rotating arms, skipping, sidesteps, butt-kicks).

* Stretching (5 activities: triceps, lunging, shoulders, hamstrings, lumbar rotation). 

* Strength (8 activities: push-ups, push-ups (complex), sit-ups, sit-ups (complex), burpees, lunges, lunges (complex), bench dips). </p>



**1.3 Hardware Setup:** <p align="justify">  The experiments were conducted on a machine equipped with 32 GB RAM, 14 CPU cores, and an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU with 6 GB of VRAM.
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> <p align="justify"> By default, the code will run on a GPU if available; otherwise, it will run on the CPU. This example runs much faster when the `ClientApp` have access to a GPU. If your system has one, try running the example with GPU support.
  
> Although it is not compulsory to use a GPU for training the TinyHAR model, as it can be efficiently trained on a CPU with minimal computation time, more complex models like DeepConvLSTM, typically used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks, often require a GPU to achieve reasonable training times.  </p>

## 2. Experimental Setup

**2.1 Task:** Human Activity Recognition


**2.2 Model:** <p align="justify"> TinyHAR, which is a lightweight deep learning model designed for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. This model architecture achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.</p>


**2.3 Data splitting:** <p align="justify">In the WEAR dataset, participants perform the same activities multiple times across different time periods to simulate realistic scenarios. This variability means that activity patterns can change over time due to factors like fatigue, weather conditions, and ground changes. To account for this, the dataset is split such that the first 20% of each labeled activity in the time series is used for testing, and the remaining 80% is used for training. This approach ensures that the testing data includes varied patterns, such as a person jogging both at the beginning and later in the exercise session.</p>

**2.4 Client setting:** In the dataset, 2 participants were re-recorded in a different season and environment, resulting in 24 subjects. These 2 additional subjects are treated as separate devices for the same individuals to reflect real-world FitTech scenarios, thus setting the number of clients to 24.

| Dataset  | classes (including NULL) | clients | 
| :------- | :------: | :------: |

## 7. FedFitTech with Case Study: Client-side Early Stopping

**7.1 Early stopping Strategy:** <p align="justify"> Our case study focuses on the FitTech domain and employs early stopping based on the validation F1-score over a sliding window. Although simple to implement, this method ensures that the global model retains valuable patterns from all clients, including those with limited generalization capability.</p>


**7.2 Implementation of FedFitTech case study** 

<p align="justify"> The FedFitTech case study presents an improved version of FedFitTech, where clients stop learning once they have converged, enhancing efficiency.
</p>

> \[!Tip\]
> To perform an experiment with the case study, you just need to change the `Early Stopping` flag in the configuration file located at `/baselines/fedfittech/fedfittech/config/base.yaml`. The updated hyperparameters will be as shown below. 


| Description | Value |
| --------------- | --------- |
|  Min available clients |  24     |
|Learning rate| 0.001|
|Local Epoch| 1 |
| Batch size | 32 |
| Optimizer | Adam |
| Window size | 100 |
| Global round | 100 |
| Number of Features | 12 |
| Number of Filters | 24 |
| Preference for NULL | True |
| Fraction fit| 1.0 |
| Fraction Evaluate | 1.0 |
| Early Stopping | **True** |

> \[!Note\]
> For logs related to early stopping, an `/baselines/fedfittech/fedfittech/Early_stoppinng_logs` folder will be created. This folder will store client-specific early stopping metadata

**7.3 Early stopping metadata**

<p align="justify">
  
Initially, the server round value will be set to `np.nan`. Once early stopping is triggered for a specific client, the corresponding `server round` value will be recorded in the early stopping log. </p>

**7.4 Evaluation Results for FedFitTech Case study**

<p align="justify"> The evaluation of this work includes a compelling comparison between FedFitTech and its client-side early stopping case study, focusing on both communication loads and the global model's performance on local data. </p>

  **7.4.1 Communication Cost**

<p align="justify"> Figure 5 illustrates that Notably, 9 out of 24 clients stopped training the global model early, with the earliest stop at round 40 and some clients stopping after more than 80 rounds. This highlights that prolonged participation does not guarantee continued benefit. </p>

  <em>Figure 5: The figure shows the number of training rounds each client attended in the case study. The Y-axis represents the F1-score, and the X-axis represents client IDs. Red indicates communication cost, green shows saved communication rounds, and the dashed black line is the mean. </em>
</p>


<p align="justify">
Figure 6 illustrates that some clients did not improve their local F1-score even after 30 rounds of training. Despite some clients being dropped, the overall global model F1-score continued to increase, as shown by the black dashed line.

Notably, some clients even have better F1-scores in the case study, specifically clients with IDs: 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, and 22. As a result, 11 out of 24 clients obtained better performance compared to FedFitTech. </p>
