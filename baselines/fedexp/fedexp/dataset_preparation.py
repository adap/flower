Please add here all the necessary logic to either download, uncompress, pre/post-process
your dataset (or all of the above). If the desired way of running your baseline is to
first download the dataset and partition it and then run the experiments, please
uncomment the lines below and tell us in the README.md (see the "Running the Experiment"
block) that this file should be executed first.
