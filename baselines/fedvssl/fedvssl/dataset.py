"""Handle basic dataset creation.

In case of PyTorch it should return dataloaders for your dataset (for both the clients
and the server). If you are using a custom dataset class, this module is the place to
define it. If your dataset requires to be downloaded (and this is not done
automatically -- e.g. as it is the case for many dataset in TorchVision) and
partitioned, please include all those functions and logic in the
`dataset_preparation.py` module. You can use all those functions from functions/methods
defined here of course.
