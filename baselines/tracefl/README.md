# TraceFL: Interpretability-Driven Debugging in Federated Learning via Neuron Provenance

> Note: If you use this baseline in your work, please remember to cite the original authors of the paper as well as the Flower paper.

**Paper:** [arxiv.org/abs/2312.13632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13632)

**Authors:** Waris Gill, Ali Anwar, Muhammad Ali Gulzar

**Abstract:** In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost. FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML debugging approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training. We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for a global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction, identifying the most crucial neurons in the global model. It then maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-art ML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.

## About this baseline

**What's implemented:** This Flower baseline implements TraceFL, the first interpretability-driven debugging technique for Federated Learning that uses fine-grained neuron provenance to identify clients responsible for specific global model predictions. The implementation replicates key experiments from the ICSE 2025 paper including: (1) Localization accuracy in correct predictions (Figure 2, Table 3, Figure 5), (2) Varying data distribution analysis (Figure 3), (3) Localization accuracy in mispredictions/faulty client detection (Table 1, Figure 6), and (4) Differential privacy-enabled FL (Figure 4, Table 2). It supports multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, DBpedia-14, Yahoo Answers Topics) and model architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, CNN, GPT, DistilBERT).

**Datasets:** MNIST (image classification), CIFAR-10 (image classification), CIFAR-100 (image classification), PathMNIST (medical imaging - colon pathology), OrganAMNIST (medical imaging - abdominal organs), DBpedia-14 (text classification), Yahoo Answers Topics (text classification). All datasets are publicly available and downloaded via Flower Datasets.

**Hardware Setup:** This baseline was tested on a desktop machine with 8 CPU cores and 32GB RAM. Experiments run efficiently on CPU-only mode with minimal resource requirements. The baseline supports both CPU and GPU execution, with GPU acceleration available for larger models. Minimum requirements: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM for basic experiments. For large-scale experiments (as in the original paper), the authors used six NVIDIA DGX A100 nodes, each with 2048GB memory, 128 cores, and an A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

## Experimental Setup

**Task:** Multi-domain classification spanning image classification, medical imaging, and text classification

**Model:** The baseline supports multiple model architectures across different domains:
- **Image Classification**: ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, DenseNet121, custom CNN
- **Medical Imaging**: ResNet and DenseNet architectures adapted for grayscale inputs (PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST)
- **Text Classification**: DistilBERT (`distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased`), GPT-based models

The default model is ResNet18 for image/medical tasks. All models output logits for classification, enabling TraceFL's consistent neuron-level interpretability mechanism across architectures.

**Dataset:** The baseline uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) / Dirichlet distribution for creating non-IID partitions across clients. The `dirichlet-alpha` parameter controls the degree of non-IIDness:
- α → ∞: All clients have identical distribution (IID)
- α → 0: Each client holds samples from only one class (extreme non-IID)
- Default α = 0.3 (moderate non-IID)

| Dataset | # Classes | # Clients | Partition Method | Default α | Samples per Client |
| :------ | :-------: | :-------: | :--------------: | :-------: | :----------------: |
| MNIST | 10 | 10 | Dirichlet | 0.3 | Up to 2048 |
