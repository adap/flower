        This method constructs a new `Message` with given content and metadata.
        The `run_id` and `src_node_id` will be set automatically.

        Parameters
        ----------
        content : RecordSet
            The content for the new message. This holds records that are to be sent
            to the destination node.
        message_type : str
            The type of the message, defining the action to be executed on
            the receiving end.
        dst_node_id : int
            The ID of the destination node to which the message is being sent.
        group_id : str
            The ID of the group to which this message is associated. In some settings,
            this is used as the FL round.
        ttl : Optional[float] (default: None)
            Time-to-live for the round trip of this message, i.e., the time from sending
            this message to receiving a reply. It specifies in seconds the duration for
            which the message and its potential reply are considered valid. If unset,
            the default TTL (i.e., `common.DEFAULT_TTL`) will be used.

        Returns
        -------
        message : Message
            A new `Message` instance with the specified content and metadata.

        Returns
        -------
        message_ids : Iterable[str]
            An iterable of IDs for the messages that were sent, which can be used

        ----------
        message_ids : Iterable[str]
            An iterable of message IDs for which reply messages are to be retrieved.

        Parameters
        ----------
        messages : Iterable[Message]
            An iterable of messages to be sent.
        timeout : Optional[float] (default: None)
            The timeout duration in seconds. If specified, the method will wait for
            replies for this duration. If `None`, there is no time limit and the method
            will wait until replies for all messages are received.

        Returns
        -------
        replies : Iterable[Message]
            An iterable of reply messages received from the SuperLink.

        Notes
        -----
        This method uses `push_messages` to send the messages and `pull_messages`
        to collect the replies. If `timeout` is set, the method may not return
        replies for all sent messages. A message remains valid until its TTL,
        which is not affected by `timeout`.
