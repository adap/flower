class RetryInvoker:
    """Wrapper class for retry (with backoff) triggered by exceptions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wait_gen_factory: Callable[[], Generator[float, None, None]]
        A generator yielding successive wait times in seconds. If the generator
        is finite, the giveup event will be triggered when the generator raises
        `StopIteration`.
    recoverable_exceptions: Union[Type[Exception], Tuple[Type[Exception]]]
        An exception type (or tuple of types) that triggers backoff.
    max_tries: Optional[int]
        The maximum number of attempts to make before giving up. Once exhausted,
        the exception will be allowed to escape. If set to None, there is no limit
        to the number of tries.
    max_time: Optional[float]
        The maximum total amount of time to try before giving up. Once this time
        has expired, this method won't be interrupted immediately, but the exception
        will be allowed to escape. If set to None, there is no limit to the total time.
    on_success: Optional[Callable[[RetryState], None]] (default: None)
        A callable to be executed in the event of success. The parameter is a
        data class object detailing the invocation.
    on_backoff: Optional[Callable[[RetryState], None]] (default: None)
        A callable to be executed in the event of a backoff. The parameter is a
        data class object detailing the invocation.
    on_giveup: Optional[Callable[[RetryState], None]] (default: None)
        A callable to be executed in the event that `max_tries` or `max_time` is
        exceeded, `should_giveup` returns True, or `wait_gen_factory()` generator raises
        `StopInteration`. The parameter is a data class object detailing the
        invocation.
    jitter: Optional[Callable[[float], float]] (default: full_jitter)
        A function of the value yielded by `wait_gen_factory()` returning the actual
        time to wait. This function helps distribute wait times stochastically to avoid
        timing collisions across concurrent clients. Wait times are jittered by
        default using the `full_jitter` function. To disable jittering, pass
        `jitter=None`.
    should_giveup: Optional[Callable[[Exception], bool]] (default: None)
        A function accepting an exception instance, returning whether or not
        to give up prematurely before other give-up conditions are evaluated.
        If set to None, the strategy is to never give up prematurely.
    wait_function: Optional[Callable[[float], None]] (default: None)
        A function that defines how to wait between retry attempts. It accepts
        one argument, the wait time in seconds, allowing the use of various waiting
        mechanisms (e.g., asynchronous waits or event-based synchronization) suitable
        for different execution environments. If set to `None`, the `wait_function`
        defaults to `time.sleep`, which is ideal for synchronous operations. Custom
        functions should manage execution flow to prevent blocking or interference.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialize a `RetryInvoker` with exponential backoff and invoke a function:

    >>> invoker = RetryInvoker(
    ...     exponential,  # Or use `lambda: exponential(3, 2)` to pass arguments
    ...     grpc.RpcError,
    ...     max_tries=3,
    ...     max_time=None,
    ... )
    >>> invoker.invoke(my_func, arg1, arg2, kw1=kwarg1)

        This method attempts to invoke the given callable, and in the event of

        retry process, various callbacks (`on_backoff`, `on_success`, and
        `on_giveup`) can be triggered based on the outcome.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target: Callable[..., Any]
            The callable to be invoked.

            Positional arguments to pass to `target`.
        **kwargs: Dict[str, Any]

        Returns
        -------
        Any

        Raises
        ------
        Exception
            If the number of tries exceeds `max_tries`, if the total time exceeds
            `max_time`, if `wait_gen_factory()` generator raises `StopInteration`,
            or if the `should_giveup` returns True for a raised exception.

        Notes
        -----
        The time between retries is determined by the provided `wait_gen_factory()`
        generator and can optionally be jittered using the `jitter` function.
        The recoverable exceptions that trigger a retry, as well as conditions to
        stop retries, are also determined by the class's initialization parameters.
