class Context:
    """Context of your run.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node_id : int
        The ID that identifies the node.
    node_config : Dict[str, str]
        A config (key/value mapping) unique to the node and independent of the
        `run_config`. This config persists across all runs this node participates in.
    state : RecordSet
        Holds records added by the entity in a given run and that will stay local.
        This means that the data it holds will never leave the system it's running from.
        This can be used as an intermediate storage or scratchpad when
        executing mods. It can also be used as a memory to access
        at different points during the lifecycle of this entity (e.g. across
        multiple rounds)
    run_config : Dict[str, Value]
        A config (key/value mapping) held by the entity in a given run and that will
        stay local. It can be used at any point during the lifecycle of this entity
        (e.g. across multiple rounds)
