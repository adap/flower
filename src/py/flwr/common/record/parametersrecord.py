        A list representing the shape of the unserialized array-like object. This is

        A string indicating the type of serialisation mechanism used to generate the

    data: bytes

class ParametersRecord(TypedDict[str, Array]):
    r"""Parameters record.

    A dataclass storing named Arrays in order. This means that it holds entries as an
    OrderedDict[str, Array]. ParametersRecord objects can be viewed as an equivalent to
    PyTorch's state_dict, but holding serialised tensors instead. A
    :code:`ParametersRecord`  is one of the types of records that a
    `flwr.common.RecordSet <flwr.common.RecordSet.html#recordset>`_ supports and
    can therefore be used to construct :code:`common.Message` objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_dict : Optional[OrderedDict[str, Array]]
        A dictionary that stores serialized array-like or tensor-like objects.
    keep_input : bool (default: False)
        A boolean indicating whether parameters should be deleted from the input
        dictionary immediately after adding them to the record. If False, the
        dictionary passed to `set_parameters()` will be empty once exiting from that
        function. This is the desired behaviour when working with very large
        models/tensors/arrays. However, if you plan to continue working with your
        parameters after adding it to the record, set this flag to True. When set
        to True, the data is duplicated in memory.

    Examples
    --------
    The usage of :code:`ParametersRecord` is envisioned for storing data arrays (e.g.
    parameters of a machine learning model). These first need to be serialized into
    a :code:`flwr.common.Array` data structure.

    Let's see some examples:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from flwr.common import ParametersRecord
    >>> from flwr.common import array_from_numpy
    >>>
    >>> # Let's create a simple NumPy array
    >>> arr_np = np.random.randn(3, 3)
    >>>
    >>> # If we print it
    >>> array([[-1.84242409, -1.01539537, -0.46528405],
    >>>      [ 0.32991896,  0.55540414,  0.44085534],
    >>>      [-0.10758364,  1.97619858, -0.37120501]])
    >>>
    >>> # Let's create an Array out of it
    >>> arr = array_from_numpy(arr_np)
    >>>
    >>> # If we print it you'll see (note the binary data)
    >>> Array(dtype='float64', shape=[3,3], stype='numpy.ndarray', data=b'@\x99\x18...')
    >>>
    >>> # Adding it to a ParametersRecord:
    >>> p_record = ParametersRecord({"my_array": arr})

    Now that the NumPy array is embedded into a :code:`ParametersRecord` it could be
    sent if added as part of a :code:`common.Message` or it could be saved as a
    persistent state of a :code:`ClientApp` via its context. Regardless of the usecase,
    we will sooner or later want to recover the array in its original NumPy
    representation. For the example above, where the array was serialized using the
    built-in utility function, deserialization can be done as follows:

    >>> # Use the Array's built-in method
    >>> arr_np_d = arr.numpy()
    >>>
    >>> # If printed, it will show the exact same data as above:
    >>> array([[-1.84242409, -1.01539537, -0.46528405],
    >>>      [ 0.32991896,  0.55540414,  0.44085534],
    >>>      [-0.10758364,  1.97619858, -0.37120501]])

    If you need finer control on how your arrays are serialized and deserialized, you
    can construct :code:`Array` objects directly like this:

    >>> from flwr.common import Array
    >>> # Serialize your array and construct Array object
    >>> arr = Array(
    >>>         data=ndarray.tobytes(),
    >>>         dtype=str(ndarray.dtype),
    >>>         stype="",  # Could be used in a deserialization function
    >>>         shape=list(ndarray.shape),
    >>>       )
    >>>
    >>> # Then you can deserialize it like this
    >>> arr_np_d = np.frombuffer(
    >>>             buffer=array.data,
    >>>             dtype=array.dtype,
    >>>            ).reshape(array.shape)

    Note that different arrays (e.g. from PyTorch, Tensorflow) might require different
    serialization mechanism. Howerver, they often support a conversion to NumPy,
    therefore allowing to use the same or similar steps as in the example above.
