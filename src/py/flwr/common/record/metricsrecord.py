    A :code:`MetricsRecord` is a Python dictionary designed to ensure that
    each key-value pair adheres to specified data types. A :code:`MetricsRecord`
    is one of the types of records that a
    `flwr.common.RecordSet <flwr.common.RecordSet.html#recordset>`_ supports and
    can therefore be used to construct :code:`common.Message` objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metrics_dict : Optional[Dict[str, MetricsRecordValues]]
        A dictionary that stores basic types (i.e. `int`, `float` as defined
        in `MetricsScalar`) and list of such types (see `MetricsScalarList`).
    keep_input : bool (default: True)
        A boolean indicating whether metrics should be deleted from the input
        dictionary immediately after adding them to the record. When set
        to True, the data is duplicated in memory. If memory is a concern, set
        it to False.

    Examples
    --------
    The usage of a :code:`MetricsRecord` is envisioned for communicating results
    obtained when a node performs an action. A few typical examples include:
    communicating the training accuracy after a model is trained locally by a
    :code:`ClientApp`, reporting the validation loss obtained at a :code:`ClientApp`,
    or, more generally, the output of executing a query by the :code:`ClientApp`.
    Common to these examples is that the output can be typically represented by
    a single scalar (:code:`int`, :code:`float`) or list of scalars.

    Let's see some examples of how to construct a :code:`MetricsRecord` from scratch:

    >>> from flwr.common import MetricsRecord
    >>>
    >>> # A `MetricsRecord` is a specialized Python dictionary
    >>> record = MetricsRecord({"accuracy": 0.94})
    >>> # You can add more content to an existing record
    >>> record["loss"] = 0.01
    >>> # It also supports lists
    >>> record["loss-historic"] = [0.9, 0.5, 0.01]

    Since types are enforced, the types of the objects inserted are checked. For a
    :code:`MetricsRecord`, value types allowed are those in defined in
    :code:`flwr.common.MetricsRecordValues`. Similarly, only :code:`str` keys are
    allowed.

    >>> from flwr.common import MetricsRecord
    >>>
    >>> record = MetricsRecord() # an empty record
    >>> # Add unsupported value
    >>> record["something-unsupported"] = {'a': 123} # Will throw a `TypeError`

    If you need a more versatily type of record try :code:`ConfigsRecord` or
    :code:`ParametersRecord`.
