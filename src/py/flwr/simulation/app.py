    """Start a Ray-based Flower simulation server.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client_fn : ClientFnExt
        A function creating Client instances. The function must have the signature
        `client_fn(node_id: int, partition_id: Optional[int]). It should return
        a single client instance of type Client. Note that the created client
        instances are ephemeral and will often be destroyed after a single method
        invocation. Since client instances are not long-lived, they should not attempt
        to carry state over method invocations. Any state required by the instance
        (model, dataset, hyperparameters, ...) should be (re-)created in either the
        call to `client_fn` or the call to any of the client methods (e.g., load
        evaluation data in the `evaluate` method itself).
    num_clients : Optional[int]
        The total number of clients in this simulation. This must be set if
        `clients_ids` is not set and vice-versa.
    clients_ids : Optional[List[str]]
        List `client_id`s for each client. This is only required if
        `num_clients` is not set. Setting both `num_clients` and `clients_ids`
        with `len(clients_ids)` not equal to `num_clients` generates an error.
        Deprecated in favour of `node_ids` argument.
    client_resources : Optional[Dict[str, float]] (default: `{"num_cpus": 1, "num_gpus": 0.0}`)
        CPU and GPU resources for a single client. Supported keys
        are `num_cpus` and `num_gpus`. To understand the GPU utilization caused by
        `num_gpus`, as well as using custom resources, please consult the Ray
        documentation.
    server : Optional[flwr.server.Server] (default: None).
        An implementation of the abstract base class `flwr.server.Server`. If no
        instance is provided, then `start_server` will create one.
    config: ServerConfig (default: None).
        Currently supported values are `num_rounds` (int, default: 1) and
        `round_timeout` in seconds (float, default: None).
    strategy : Optional[flwr.server.Strategy] (default: None)
        An implementation of the abstract base class `flwr.server.Strategy`. If
        no strategy is provided, then `start_server` will use
        `flwr.server.strategy.FedAvg`.
    client_manager : Optional[flwr.server.ClientManager] (default: None)
        An implementation of the abstract base class `flwr.server.ClientManager`.
        If no implementation is provided, then `start_simulation` will use
        `flwr.server.client_manager.SimpleClientManager`.
    ray_init_args : Optional[Dict[str, Any]] (default: None)
        Optional dictionary containing arguments for the call to `ray.init`.
        If ray_init_args is None (the default), Ray will be initialized with
        the following default args:

        { "ignore_reinit_error": True, "include_dashboard": False }

        An empty dictionary can be used (ray_init_args={}) to prevent any
        arguments from being passed to ray.init.
    keep_initialised: Optional[bool] (default: False)
        Set to True to prevent `ray.shutdown()` in case `ray.is_initialized()=True`.

    actor_type: VirtualClientEngineActor (default: ClientAppActor)
        Optionally specify the type of actor to use. The actor object, which
        persists throughout the simulation, will be the process in charge of
        executing a ClientApp wrapping input argument `client_fn`.

    actor_kwargs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] (default: None)
        If you want to create your own Actor classes, you might need to pass
        some input argument. You can use this dictionary for such purpose.

    actor_scheduling: Optional[Union[str, NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy]]
        (default: "DEFAULT")
        Optional string ("DEFAULT" or "SPREAD") for the VCE to choose in which
        node the actor is placed. If you are an advanced user needed more control
        you can use lower-level scheduling strategies to pin actors to specific
        compute nodes (e.g. via NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy). Please note this
        is an advanced feature. For all details, please refer to the Ray documentation:
        https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/index.html
    nodes_ids : Optional[List[int]]
        List node ids for each client. This is only required if
        `num_clients` is not set. Setting both `num_clients` and `node_ids`
        with `len(node_ids)` not equal to `num_clients` generates an error.

    Returns
