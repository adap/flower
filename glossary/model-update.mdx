A model update is the information a client returns to the server after executing a task. Depending on the system and algorithm, it can be full model parameters (weights), parameter deltas, gradients, optimizer state, or other sufficient statistics.

## Why it matters
- The update format determines bandwidth cost and aggregation design.
- The update format affects privacy and attack surface.

## In federated settings
Many systems aggregate deltas or weights (as in FedAvg), but some approaches aggregate gradients or other statistics. Updates are often weighted by the number of local examples.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating “weights” and “updates” as interchangeable can hide important algorithmic differences.
- Updates can leak information about local data; privacy defenses must be explicit.

## In Flower
In Flower, what is sent and how it is aggregated is defined by the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) inside a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp), with updates exchanged between [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
