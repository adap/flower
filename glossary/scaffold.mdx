SCAFFOLD is an optimization technique for federated learning that reduces client drift by using control variates—additional correction terms that help align local updates with the global optimization direction.

## Why it matters
- Can improve convergence when client updates are biased due to non-IID data.

## In federated settings
By correcting local updates, SCAFFOLD helps ensure that local training steps do not systematically move the model in conflicting directions across clients.

## Common pitfalls
- Requires maintaining and communicating extra state (control variates).
- Implementation complexity is higher than FedAvg.

## In Flower
In Flower, SCAFFOLD-style behavior is typically implemented as a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) that coordinates additional state across rounds in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
