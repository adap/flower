Multi-run (also called multi-tenancy or multi-job) is the ability to run multiple federated workloads on the same underlying federation infrastructure. A single SuperLink and set of SuperNodes can support different ServerApp/ClientApp pairs across separate runs.

## Why it matters
- Improves infrastructure reuse and operational efficiency.
- Enables running multiple experiments or products without redeploying the federation.

## In federated settings
Multi-run requires isolation of configuration, artifacts, and observability across runs, while sharing durable connectivity and fleet management.

## Common pitfalls
- Mixing metrics and logs across runs, making evaluation misleading.
- Weak isolation between runs (configuration, access control, or resource limits).

## In Flower
In Flower, multi-run is enabled by separating long-running infrastructure ([SuperLink](/glossary/superlink)/[SuperNode](/glossary/supernode)) from short-lived apps ([ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp)/[ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp)) managed by [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
