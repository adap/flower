FedProx is a federated optimization approach designed to handle heterogeneity by adding a proximal term to the client’s local objective. Intuitively, it discourages local models from drifting too far from the current global model during local training.

## Why it matters
- Often improves stability when client data and resources vary widely.

## In federated settings
FedProx is especially relevant when local training is imperfect due to non-IID data or when clients perform varying amounts of local computation.

## Common pitfalls
- The proximal strength hyperparameter must be tuned.
- It mitigates, but does not eliminate, challenges from strong non-IID data.

## In Flower
In Flower, FedProx-style behavior is typically implemented via a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) and client training logic in a [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp), in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
