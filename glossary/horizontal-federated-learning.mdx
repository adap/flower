Horizontal federated learning is the standard setting where clients have the same feature space (same input schema) but different samples (different rows). This matches many real-world scenarios like user devices or multiple sites collecting the same type of data.

## Why it matters
- Most classic FL algorithms (like FedAvg) assume this setting.

## In federated settings
Clients train the same model architecture locally and share updates that can be aggregated directly.

## Common pitfalls
- Even with the same schema, preprocessing differences can break assumptions.
- Non-IID label/feature distributions can still be severe.

## In Flower
In Flower, most built-in examples and many default [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) patterns assume horizontal federated learning and run in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
