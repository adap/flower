SuperNode is a long-running Flower process on the client side. It connects to the SuperLink, requests tasks, executes them locally, and returns results.

## Why it matters
- Provides a durable client-side component for intermittent or long-running federations.
- Separates networking concerns from short-lived client-side training/evaluation code.

## In federated settings
Client-side runtimes must handle heterogeneous environments, limited resources, and unreliable connectivity while preserving correctness and observability.

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming all clients can run the same runtime environment; cross-device deployments may require multiple client implementations.
- Confusing SuperNode with the “client” concept; it is one possible implementation of a federated client.

## In Flower
In Flower, SuperNode coordinates with [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) to run a [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) and communicates with [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) for task orchestration in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
