Non-IID (non–independently and identically distributed) data describes the common federated setting where each client’s data distribution differs from the overall population and from other clients.

## Why it matters
- Can slow convergence and destabilize training.
- Can lead to uneven performance across clients and cohorts.

## In federated settings
Non-IID can arise from label skew, feature skew, different behaviors, or different data collection processes across clients.

## Common pitfalls
- Reporting only a single average metric can hide poor performance for specific clients.
- Some optimization settings that work centrally can fail under strong non-IID heterogeneity.

## In Flower
In Flower, non-IID behavior is often studied using [Flower Datasets](/glossary/flower-datasets) in the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) to benchmark how different [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) choices behave under heterogeneity.
