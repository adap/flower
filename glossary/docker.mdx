Docker is an open-source containerization tool for deploying and running applications. Docker
containers encapsulate an application's code, dependencies, and configuration files, allowing
for consistent and reliable deployment across different environments.

In the context of federated learning, Docker containers can be used to package the entire client
and server application, including all the necessary dependencies, and then deployed on various
devices such as edge devices, cloud servers, or even on-premises servers.

In Flower, Docker containers are used to containerize various applications like `SuperLink`,
`SuperNode`, and `SuperExec`. Flower's Docker images allow users to quickly get Flower up and
running, reducing the time and effort required to set up and configure the necessary software
and dependencies.
