Docker is a containerization platform that packages an application and its dependencies into a container image. Containers help run the same software reliably across different machines and operating systems.

## Why it matters
Federated systems often include multiple moving parts (server infrastructure, client-side runtimes, and project-specific apps). Containers simplify deployment, versioning, and reproducibility across heterogeneous environments.

## In federated settings
Docker can be used to package federated infrastructure components and application code so they can be deployed consistently in cloud, on-prem, or edge environments. Containerization can also help with:
- reproducible experiments (pinning dependencies)
- operational rollouts (known-good images)
- isolation of runtime dependencies

## Common pitfalls
- Treating containers as a security boundary by default. Container security depends on configuration and operational controls.
- Forgetting that client devices may not support Docker (many cross-device scenarios require native/mobile runtimes).
- Shipping oversized images, increasing bandwidth and startup time.

## In Flower
In Flower, Docker images are commonly used to deploy the [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink), [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode), and [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) components of the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
