Flower Datasets is a library for working with datasets in federated settings. It supports creating federated-style partitions from centralized datasets and working with datasets that are naturally partitioned across sources.

## Why it matters
Federated methods are strongly affected by how data is distributed across clients. Being able to create reproducible partitions and study different types of heterogeneity is essential for meaningful experiments and comparisons.

## In federated settings
Flower Datasets supports:
- **Simulated federated partitions**: split a centralized dataset into per-client partitions that exhibit different kinds of statistical heterogeneity (for example label skew or quantity skew).
- **Naturally partitioned datasets**: datasets that already come separated by client/site/user, which can better reflect real deployments.

This makes it useful for federated learning, federated evaluation, and federated analytics experiments.

## Common pitfalls
- Over-interpreting results from a single partitioning scheme; different heterogeneity patterns can change conclusions.
- Treating simulated partitions as identical to real-world partitions (availability, preprocessing, and non-stationarity are often missing).
- Failing to document partitioning parameters, making experiments hard to reproduce.

## In Flower
In Flower, Flower Datasets is commonly used in the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) to create reproducible, heterogeneous client partitions for benchmarking [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) behavior.
