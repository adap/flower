Flower Datasets is a library that enables the creation of datasets for federated learning/analytics/evaluation by partitioning centralized datasets to exhibit heterogeneity or using naturally partitioned datasets. It was created by the Flower Labs team, which also created Flower - A Friendly Federated AI Framework.

The key features include:
* downloading datasets (HuggingFace `datasets` are used under the hood),
* partitioning (simulate different levels of heterogeneity by using one of the implemented partitioning schemes or create your own),
* creating centralized datasets (easily utilize centralized versions of the datasets),
* reproducibility (repeat the experiments with the same results),
* visualization (display the created partitions),
* ML agnostic (easy integration with all popular ML frameworks).


It is a supplementary library to Flower, with which it integrates easily.
