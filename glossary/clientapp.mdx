In Flower, a ClientApp is a short-lived application process that runs project-specific code on the client side. It is responsible for tasks like local training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

## Why it matters
- Separates client ML logic from long-running networking components.
- Enables running different projects on the same federation over time.

## In federated settings
Client-side application code is where local data handling, preprocessing, training loops, and privacy-related transformations are implemented.

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming client code is identical across devices; client environments can vary significantly.
- Mixing long-running networking responsibilities with short-lived training logic, making upgrades harder.

## In Flower
In Flower, ClientApp processes are launched and managed by [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) and typically invoked by [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
