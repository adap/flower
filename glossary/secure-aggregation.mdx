Secure aggregation is a cryptographic protocol that allows a server to compute an aggregate (often a sum) of client contributions without learning any individual client’s contribution in the clear. The server only learns the final aggregate.

## Why it matters
- Reduces the risk of the server inspecting individual model updates.
- Complements differential privacy and other privacy mechanisms.

## In federated settings
Secure aggregation is commonly used for aggregating model updates or analytics statistics. Many protocols must handle dropouts and partial participation.

## Common pitfalls
- Secure aggregation does not automatically prevent all leakage (the aggregate itself can still be sensitive).
- Protocol complexity and dropout handling can be significant.

## In Flower
In Flower, secure aggregation is typically integrated into the aggregation path defined by the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy), often paired with client-side changes in a [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) depending on the threat model.
