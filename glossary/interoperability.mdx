Interoperability is the ability to run federated workloads across heterogeneous environments—different operating systems, hardware, programming languages, and machine learning frameworks—while keeping the protocol and semantics consistent.

## Why it matters
- Real federations are heterogeneous (mobile, edge, servers, different stacks).
- Interoperability reduces integration cost and increases adoption.

## In federated settings
Interoperability typically requires well-defined protocols, serialization formats, and clear contracts for what is exchanged (model updates, metrics, configs).

## Common pitfalls
- Silent differences in preprocessing, model parameter ordering, or numeric precision can break training/evaluation.
- Treating interoperability as purely a transport problem; semantics matter.

## In Flower
In Flower, interoperability is supported by the communication stack used by [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode), allowing heterogeneous clients to participate under a shared protocol.
