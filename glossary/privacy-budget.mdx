A privacy budget quantifies the strength of a differential privacy guarantee, commonly expressed as parameters ε (epsilon) and δ (delta). Informally, smaller ε indicates stronger privacy (but typically lower utility), while δ bounds a small probability of larger privacy loss.

## Why it matters
- Enables comparing DP configurations and communicating privacy guarantees.
- Helps teams reason about cumulative privacy loss across repeated computations.

## In federated settings
Privacy budgets compose across rounds, meaning repeated training/evaluation/analytics consumes more privacy budget.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating ε as a label without specifying δ, accounting method, and threat model.
- Comparing ε values across different settings without considering differences in mechanism and sensitivity.

## In Flower
In Flower, DP accounting is typically reported alongside experiments implemented in a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp)/[ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) pair and coordinated by a [Strategy](/glossary/strategy).
