Federated analytics is the computation of aggregate statistics (for example counts, sums, histograms, or other population-level measurements) across many data holders without centralizing their raw data. Clients compute local contributions and a coordinator aggregates them.

## Why it matters
- Supports product and model insights when raw data cannot be collected.
- Often cheaper than training a model when you only need aggregates.
- Can be combined with privacy mechanisms (secure aggregation, differential privacy).

## In federated settings
Unlike federated learning, federated analytics typically does not update model parameters. The “payload” is usually statistics, sketches, or intermediate aggregates rather than weights.

## Common pitfalls
- Aggregation choices can bias results (who participates, how they’re weighted).
- Privacy requires explicit design; even aggregates can be sensitive.

## In Flower
In Flower, federated analytics is typically orchestrated by a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) and executed by [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) processes in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
