Vertical federated learning is the setting where different parties hold different feature sets (different columns) for overlapping entities (shared users/customers). Training requires coordinating across parties while aligning entity identities and protecting sensitive features.

## Why it matters
- Enables learning when no single party has all the relevant features.

## In federated settings
Vertical FL typically cannot use simple weight averaging because data is partitioned by features, not by samples. It often relies on secure computation, split learning-style designs, or specialized protocols.

## Common pitfalls
- Entity alignment and governance are major practical challenges.
- Privacy and leakage risks can be higher due to cross-party feature correlation.

## In Flower
In Flower, vertical FL typically requires specialized protocol work in [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp)/[ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) beyond standard FedAvg-style [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) workflows.
