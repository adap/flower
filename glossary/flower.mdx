Flower is an open-source framework for building federated AI systems, including federated learning, federated evaluation, and federated analytics. It supports both simulation (for experimentation at scale) and deployment (for real federations).

## Why it matters
- Provides reusable building blocks for orchestration, communication, and aggregation.
- Separates project-specific ML code from long-running infrastructure components.

## In federated settings
Flower aims to make it practical to move from research experiments to production-like deployments while keeping federated concepts explicit (rounds, selection, aggregation, and metrics).

## Common pitfalls
- Treating “using a framework” as a substitute for threat modeling; privacy/security still require explicit design.
- Assuming simulation results directly transfer to real deployments without accounting for system constraints.

## In Flower
In Flower, the core extension points are the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) and app processes ([ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp)/[ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp)) that run in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
