Client selection (or client sampling) is the process of choosing which clients participate in a federated round. Selection may be random, availability-based, stratified, or constrained by device, fairness, or policy requirements.

## Why it matters
- Determines representativeness of training/evaluation.
- Controls compute and communication cost per round.

## In federated settings
In cross-device settings, selection must account for intermittent availability and resource constraints. In cross-silo settings, selection is often more stable but may be governed by organizational rules.

## Common pitfalls
- Always selecting “fast” clients can bias the model.
- Evaluating only selected clients can create misleading metrics.

## In Flower
In Flower, client selection is implemented in the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) inside a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp), with tasks routed via [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) to [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode).
