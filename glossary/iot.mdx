The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical devices—sensors, actuators, appliances, industrial equipment—that are connected to networks and produce or consume data. IoT systems often include constrained endpoints, gateways, and cloud services for management and analytics.

## Why it matters
- IoT fleets generate highly distributed, often sensitive data that is costly or undesirable to centralize.
- Many use cases have real-time or low-latency requirements best served by local computation.
- Device heterogeneity and long-lived deployments make operational reliability and upgrades first-class concerns.

## In federated settings
IoT deployments are a common substrate for federated AI: devices or gateways can act as clients that train models, evaluate, or compute aggregate statistics locally. Compared to data-center settings, IoT participation is often intermittent, highly heterogeneous, and strongly [non-IID](/glossary/non-iid-data), which impacts both optimization and the representativeness of aggregated results.

IoT systems can also motivate [hierarchical federated learning](/glossary/hierarchical-federated-learning) (device → gateway → cloud), where intermediate nodes aggregate results before forwarding them upstream to reduce wide-area bandwidth and latency.

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming “no raw data is sent” implies privacy; metrics and updates can still leak information without explicit defenses and a clear threat model.
- Overestimating what endpoints can do: many devices cannot support heavy local training due to power, memory, or background execution limits.
- Ignoring consistency across the fleet (feature extraction, preprocessing, label definitions), which can make aggregation unreliable.
- Evaluating only the “available” subset of devices, leading to selection bias.

## In Flower
In Flower, IoT endpoints or gateways can participate via the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime), where a [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) receives tasks from [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and runs project logic in a [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) under a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy).
