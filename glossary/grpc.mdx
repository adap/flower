gRPC is a framework for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that helps distributed services communicate efficiently. It is commonly paired with **Protocol Buffers** for defining interfaces and serializing messages.

## Why it matters
Federated systems are distributed systems: they rely on frequent, structured exchanges of tasks, configurations, model updates, and metrics. An efficient RPC layer can improve performance and simplify multi-language interoperability.

## In federated settings
Network constraints (bandwidth, latency, intermittent connectivity) are often central bottlenecks in federated learning. Using an efficient transport and serialization format can reduce overhead, but the dominant cost is usually the size and frequency of exchanged payloads (for example model updates).

## Common pitfalls
- Confusing “gRPC client/server” (networking roles) with “federated learning client/server” (participant roles). They are different concepts.
- Assuming transport efficiency solves scalability; algorithmic communication efficiency (update size, number of rounds) often matters more.
- Breaking compatibility when evolving message schemas without a migration strategy.

## In Flower
In Flower, gRPC is part of the communication stack used by the [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) components to exchange structured tasks and results.
