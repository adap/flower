A round is one iteration of a federated workflow in which a coordinator selects clients, sends them a task (often including a model), clients execute locally, and the results are aggregated to update the global state.

## Why it matters
- Rounds define the cadence of communication and coordination cost.
- Many design choices (sampling, local computation, aggregation) happen at the round level.

## In federated settings
A typical training round includes: client selection → broadcasting the current global model/config → local training → sending model updates → aggregation.

## Common pitfalls
- Confusing rounds with epochs: epochs are passes over data; rounds are communication iterations.
- Dropouts and stragglers can cause incomplete or delayed rounds.

## In Flower
In Flower, round orchestration is implemented in the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy), running in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
