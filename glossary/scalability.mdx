Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing workload by adding resources and/or improving efficiency. In federated AI, “workload” can mean more clients, more rounds, larger models, more concurrent runs, or more evaluation/analytics tasks.

## Why it matters
Federated systems are often motivated by scale: many participants, geographically distributed deployments, and repeated coordination over time. If the system doesn’t scale, cost and latency can dominate and the federation becomes impractical.

## In federated settings
Scalability has both **algorithmic** and **systems** dimensions:
- **Algorithmic scalability**: communication cost per round, number of rounds needed, model/update size, and techniques like **partial participation** and update compression.
- **Systems scalability**: connection management, task scheduling, handling stragglers and dropouts, and observability across a large fleet.

Scaling also changes what “representative” means: who participates (and who does not) can influence both model quality and reported metrics.

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming that an algorithm that scales in simulation will behave the same in deployment. Real networks and availability patterns can dominate.
- Optimizing for throughput at the expense of representativeness (selection bias toward “fast” or “always online” clients).
- Ignoring end-to-end cost (communication, retries, storage, monitoring) when evaluating scalability.

## In Flower
In Flower, scalability is addressed in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime), with coordination handled by [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink)/[SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) and orchestration defined by a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy).
