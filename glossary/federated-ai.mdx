Federated AI is an umbrella term for executing AI workloads across multiple data holders without moving raw data into a single central location. Instead, computation is brought to where the data lives, and only limited results—such as model updates, metrics, or aggregate statistics—are shared.

## Why it matters
- Enables collaboration when data sharing is restricted (privacy, regulation, ownership).
- Reduces the need to copy or pool large datasets.
- Makes it possible to learn from diverse, real-world data sources.

## In federated settings
Federated AI includes federated learning (training models), federated evaluation (measuring model performance across clients), and federated analytics (computing aggregate statistics across clients).

## Common pitfalls
- “Federated” does not automatically mean “private”; updates and metrics can still leak information.
- System design (threat model, aggregation, access control) matters as much as the ML algorithm.

## In Flower
In Flower, federated workloads are orchestrated via a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) and run in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
