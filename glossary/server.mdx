A server is the coordinating entity in a federated system. It orchestrates **rounds** by selecting clients, sending them tasks (often including a model/config), receiving results back, and aggregating those results to update the global state.

## Why it matters
The server defines how the federation behaves: which clients participate, how results are combined, and what is measured and reported. Server choices drive scalability, robustness, and representativeness.

## In federated settings
In federated learning, the server maintains a global model and updates it via aggregation. In federated evaluation or analytics, the server aggregates locally computed metrics or statistics. Compared to centralized distributed training, federated servers must deal with partial participation, client dropouts, and heterogeneous client capabilities and data distributions.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating the server as “trusted” by default. Privacy and security guarantees depend on the threat model and defenses (for example secure aggregation and differential privacy).
- Aggregating metrics without specifying weighting (by clients vs by examples).
- Overfitting to clients that are easiest to reach (selection bias).

## In Flower
In Flower, the server side is split between long-running infrastructure ([SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec)) and short-lived project code ([ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp)) in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime). The server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) defines client selection, task configuration, and aggregation.
