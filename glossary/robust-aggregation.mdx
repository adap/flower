Robust aggregation refers to aggregation rules designed to reduce the influence of faulty or adversarial (Byzantine) client updates. Examples include coordinate-wise median, trimmed mean, and other techniques that downweight or filter outliers.

## Why it matters
- Helps defend against poisoning and some failure modes.
- Can improve stability when some client updates are corrupted.

## In federated settings
Robust aggregation is a key tool when clients are not fully trusted, but it must be balanced against natural heterogeneity and non-IID behavior.

## Common pitfalls
- Robust aggregation can hurt performance when data is strongly non-IID (legitimate updates may look like outliers).
- It does not replace authentication, secure aggregation, or DP; it addresses a different risk.

## In Flower
In Flower, robust aggregation is typically implemented by customizing the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) inside a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp).
