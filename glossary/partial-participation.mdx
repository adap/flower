Partial participation means that only a subset of all eligible clients contributes updates in each federated round. This is common when the number of clients is large or availability is limited.

## Why it matters
- Makes federated learning feasible at scale.
- Changes convergence behavior and variance of updates.

## In federated settings
Partial participation is often parameterized as a fraction of clients per round. It interacts with client selection, dropouts, and weighting.

## Common pitfalls
- Mistaking “partial participation” (by design) for “dropout” (by failure).
- Overfitting to the frequently participating subset.

## In Flower
In Flower, partial participation is configured in the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) and can be explored in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
