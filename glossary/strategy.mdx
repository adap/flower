A strategy is the server-side policy that controls how a federated workload runs: which clients participate, what configuration they receive, and how results (updates, metrics) are aggregated.

## Why it matters
- Encodes the “algorithm” at the orchestration level.
- Determines behavior under partial participation, dropouts, and heterogeneity.

## In federated settings
Strategies can implement FedAvg-like averaging, adaptive server optimization, robust aggregation, custom evaluation aggregation, and more.

## Common pitfalls
- Over-customizing without clear evaluation; strategy changes can introduce subtle bias or instability.
- Aggregating metrics without defining weighting and cohort reporting.

## In Flower
In Flower, a Strategy typically runs inside a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp) and can be reused across both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
