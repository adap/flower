Personalized federated learning (pFL) is a set of methods that aim to provide better client-specific performance than a single global model. Instead of optimizing only for an “average” client, pFL explicitly targets per-client or per-cohort adaptation.

## Why it matters
- A single global model can be suboptimal when clients are highly heterogeneous.
- Personalization can improve fairness and user experience.

## In federated settings
Personalization can be achieved via fine-tuning, multi-task learning, clustered FL, shared representations, or partial model sharing.

## Common pitfalls
- Evaluation is harder: you must define whether you report global performance, average personalized performance, or worst-case performance.
- Personalization can increase compute and storage requirements on clients.

## In Flower
In Flower, personalization is typically implemented in a [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp), optionally coordinated by a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy).
