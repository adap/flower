Cross-silo federated learning trains across a small number of data silos such as hospitals, banks, or data centers. Compared to cross-device FL, participants are typically more reliable, have better connectivity, and hold larger datasets.

## Why it matters
- Enables collaboration across organizations without pooling sensitive data.
- Often provides stronger operational control and observability than cross-device FL.

## In federated settings
Cross-silo deployments often have explicit governance, agreements, and stable participation schedules.

## Common pitfalls
- Assuming cross-silo FL is “easy” because clients are stable; heterogeneity and privacy/security still apply.
- Evaluation can be politically sensitive; define aggregation and reporting carefully.

## In Flower
In Flower, cross-silo deployments typically run in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime), coordinating long-running [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) processes at sites through a central [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink).
