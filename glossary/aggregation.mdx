Aggregation is the server-side step that combines results from multiple clients into a single update of the global state. In federated learning, this usually means combining client **model updates** to produce the next **global model**; in federated evaluation or analytics, it can mean combining metrics or statistics.

## Why it matters
Aggregation largely determines the behavior of a federated system: stability under heterogeneity, resistance to faulty or malicious updates, and how representative the global model is of the target population.

## In federated settings
The simplest aggregation rule is a weighted average of client parameters or deltas (as in **FedAvg**), often weighted by the number of local examples. More advanced approaches apply server-side optimization (**FedOpt**) or use robust rules (for example trimmed mean or median) when some client updates might be unreliable or adversarial.

Aggregation is also where systems decide:
- how to weight clients (micro vs macro-style weighting)
- what is aggregated (weights, deltas, gradients, metrics, histograms)
- what information is revealed (plain aggregation vs **secure aggregation**)

## Common pitfalls
- Averaging per-client metrics can be misleading unless you specify whether you weight by examples or by clients.
- “Robust” aggregation can mistakenly downweight legitimate updates when data is strongly non-IID.
- Secure aggregation hides individual updates, which can limit debugging and some defenses; plan for observability separately.

## In Flower
In Flower, aggregation is defined by the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) inside a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp) and runs in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
