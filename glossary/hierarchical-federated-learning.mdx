Hierarchical federated learning performs aggregation in multiple levels. For example, devices send updates to an edge aggregator, which aggregates locally and forwards a combined update upstream to a central server.

## Why it matters
- Reduces bandwidth and latency across wide-area links.
- Better matches real deployments with gateways and regional infrastructure.

## In federated settings
Hierarchical FL can be viewed as “federated learning with intermediate aggregation points,” which changes system and statistical behavior compared to a single central server.

## Common pitfalls
- Intermediate aggregators become security and trust focal points.
- Heterogeneity and bias can appear at each hierarchy level.

## In Flower
In Flower, hierarchical FL is typically implemented by composing aggregation layers in the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) and aligning coordinators with the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime) topology.
