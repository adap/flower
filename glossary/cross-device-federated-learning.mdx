Cross-device federated learning trains across a very large number of devices such as smartphones, laptops, or edge devices. Devices are often intermittently available, have limited compute/battery/network, and typically hold small, highly non-IID datasets.

## Why it matters
- Enables learning from real-world user behavior without collecting raw user data centrally.
- Requires robust system design for unreliable participation.

## In federated settings
Cross-device FL commonly uses partial participation, strict client eligibility constraints (charging, Wi‑Fi), and careful privacy defenses.

## Common pitfalls
- Selection bias due to availability constraints.
- High variance due to small local datasets.

## In Flower
In Flower, cross-device deployments typically run in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime) with many [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) participants coordinated by a central [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink).
