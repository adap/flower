Edge computing is a distributed systems approach that places computation and often short-term storage close to where data is generated—on devices, gateways, or nearby servers—rather than sending everything to a centralized cloud. The goal is typically to reduce latency and bandwidth, improve resilience to connectivity issues, and keep more processing under local control.

## Why it matters
- Many real-world data sources are naturally “at the edge” (phones, sensors, industrial equipment).
- Network constraints (latency, bandwidth, intermittent connectivity) often dominate system design.
- Keeping computation local can reduce the need to move sensitive or high-volume data.

## In federated settings
Federated AI workloads commonly run at the edge: clients perform local training, evaluation, or analytics and only share constrained outputs (for example [model updates](/glossary/model-update) or aggregate statistics). Edge deployments tend to have strong [system heterogeneity](/glossary/heterogeneity-in-federated-learning) (compute, memory, connectivity) and [partial participation](/glossary/partial-participation), which affects convergence, metric representativeness, and operational reliability.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating “edge” as synonymous with “private”: privacy is not guaranteed without explicit mechanisms and a clear threat model.
- Underestimating operational constraints (background execution limits, power, flaky networks, updates).
- Assuming edge computing implies federated learning; edge workloads can be centralized or federated depending on the coordination design.

## In Flower
In Flower, edge devices typically participate as [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) instances in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime), executing a [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) while a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) coordinates rounds; the same logic can be stress-tested at scale in the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime).
