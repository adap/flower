In Flower, a ServerApp is a short-lived application process that runs project-specific server-side code. It defines how clients are selected, how tasks are configured, and how results are aggregated.

## Why it matters
- Separates experiment/application logic from long-running infrastructure.
- Enables multiple projects to share the same deployment infrastructure.

## In federated settings
Server-side application code is where you define the orchestration policy and aggregation behavior, which strongly influences training stability and evaluation correctness.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating server code as purely orchestration; aggregation and evaluation choices can embed bias.
- Hard-coding assumptions about client availability or data distributions.

## In Flower
In Flower, ServerApp processes are launched and managed by [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) and typically host the server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) logic.
