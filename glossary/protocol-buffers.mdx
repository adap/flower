Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) are a schema-based format for serializing structured data. You define messages and services in a `.proto` file and generate language-specific code to read/write those messages efficiently.

## Why it matters
Federated systems are distributed systems. Efficient, well-specified serialization helps keep communication fast and enables **interoperability** across languages and platforms.

## In federated settings
Federated workloads exchange structured payloads such as configuration, metrics, and (sometimes) model parameters or references to them. A schema-based approach helps:
- evolve protocols over time (schema evolution)
- detect incompatibilities early
- keep payloads compact compared to text formats

## Common pitfalls
- Making incompatible schema changes without a versioning/migration plan.
- Confusing “backward compatible schema” with “backward compatible semantics”; meaning can still change even if parsing succeeds.
- Assuming serialization overhead dominates communication cost; model update size often dominates.

## In Flower
In Flower, Protobuf (often via [gRPC](/glossary/grpc)) is used to exchange structured messages between [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) components.
