A client is a participant in a federated system that holds local data and compute. Clients connect to a coordinating server to execute tasks (for example local training, evaluation, or analytics) and return results such as **model updates**, metrics, or aggregate statistics.

## Why it matters
The client boundary is the core reason federated approaches exist: data stays under the client’s control, while computation happens locally. Client constraints (compute, network, policy) shape what algorithms and deployments are feasible.

## In federated settings
Clients are not just “workers” like in centralized distributed training. In real federations, clients can be intermittently available, heterogeneous, and have data distributions that differ significantly from the overall population (non-IID). Common patterns include:
- **Cross-device** clients (phones/edge devices) with small datasets and limited resources
- **Cross-silo** clients (organizations/sites) with larger datasets and more stable participation

Clients can participate in training rounds, federated evaluation, and federated analytics depending on the workload.

## Common pitfalls
- Confusing a federated learning **client** with a “gRPC client” (a networking term). In FL, “client” means a data holder/participant.
- Assuming clients are trusted. Threat models often include malicious or faulty clients.
- Comparing client metrics without ensuring consistent preprocessing and metric definitions.

## In Flower
In Flower, a federated client is typically a long-running [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) in the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime). It launches [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) processes via [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) to execute project-specific code.
