SuperExec is a long-running Flower process that schedules, launches, and manages application processes (such as ClientApp and ServerApp) on demand.

## Why it matters
- Enables multi-run/multi-tenancy by running different app processes over time.
- Keeps long-running infrastructure stable while swapping short-lived project code.

## In federated settings
Separating durable connectivity from project code helps federated systems run multiple workloads and update application logic without restarting the federation runtime.

## Common pitfalls
- Treating process management as an implementation detail; it affects isolation, observability, and operational safety.
- Overlooking resource limits when running multiple app processes concurrently.

## In Flower
In Flower, SuperExec is started by [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) or [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) and manages short-lived [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp) and [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) processes to enable [Multi-run](/glossary/multi-run).
