SuperLink is a long-running Flower process on the server side responsible for forwarding task instructions to clients (SuperNodes) and receiving task results back.

## Why it matters
- Handles durable connectivity and routing so application code can focus on federated logic.
- Enables multi-run scenarios where many app processes share the same federation runtime.

## In federated settings
The coordination layer must handle partial participation, retries, and observability without requiring application code to manage networking details.

## Common pitfalls
- Confusing SuperLink (infrastructure) with “server” as a federated learning concept; the server also includes project-specific orchestration logic.
- Treating the communication layer as the full security story; authentication and authorization still matter.

## In Flower
In Flower, SuperLink coordinates with [SuperExec](/glossary/superexec) to schedule a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp) and communicates with [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) processes for client-side execution.
