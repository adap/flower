Evaluation is the process of measuring a model’s performance on data that was not used to fit the model. It typically reports metrics such as accuracy, loss, AUC, or F1 to help determine whether a model generalizes and meets product or research requirements.

## Why it matters
Without evaluation, it’s easy to ship models that look good in training but fail in real-world conditions. In federated settings, evaluation is also the primary way to detect regressions that impact specific client cohorts.

## In federated settings
In federated learning, evaluation is often performed **locally** on clients and then aggregated on the server (**federated evaluation**). This enables assessing performance across heterogeneous client distributions without centralizing evaluation data.

How you aggregate matters. For example, averaging per-client accuracies (macro-style) is different from weighting by the number of local examples (micro-style). Under non-IID data, these choices can change conclusions.

## Common pitfalls
- **Selection bias**: evaluating only on available or sampled clients can misrepresent the population.
- **Incomparable metrics**: differences in preprocessing, label definitions, or metric implementations can invalidate aggregated results.
- **Non-linear metrics**: aggregating F1-score or AUC requires a clear definition of what is aggregated (per-client metrics vs pooled counts).

## In Flower
In Flower, evaluation is typically orchestrated by a server-side [Strategy](/glossary/strategy) in a [ServerApp](/glossary/serverapp) and executed by [ClientApp](/glossary/clientapp) processes in both the [simulation runtime](/glossary/simulation-runtime) and the [deployment runtime](/glossary/deployment-runtime).
