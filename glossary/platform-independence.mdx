Platform independence is the ability for software to run across different operating systems and hardware architectures with minimal or no platform-specific changes. In federated AI, this often means clients and servers can participate from heterogeneous environments while following the same protocol and semantics.

## Why it matters
- Real federations are heterogeneous (mobile, edge, servers, different hardware).
- Platform independence reduces integration and maintenance costs.
- It enables incremental rollouts as fleets evolve over time.

## In federated settings
Federated systems must coordinate across environments that differ not only by operating system, but also by programming language, ML framework, and numeric behavior. Achieving platform independence typically requires:
- a stable communication protocol and serialization format for messages and payloads
- clear contracts for what is exchanged (for example [model updates](/glossary/model-update) and metrics)
- careful control of preprocessing and model parameter conventions to avoid silent incompatibilities

## Common pitfalls
- Treating platform independence as only a packaging problem; protocol semantics and preprocessing consistency matter.
- Assuming numeric results will match across hardware (for example due to floating point differences).
- Overlooking security boundaries: interoperability can increase the attack surface if authentication and authorization are not designed explicitly.

## In Flower
In Flower, platform independence is achieved by keeping coordination at the protocol level: [SuperLink](/glossary/superlink) and [SuperNode](/glossary/supernode) communicate via shared interfaces (see [gRPC](/glossary/grpc) and [Protocol Buffers](/glossary/protocol-buffers)), enabling heterogeneous clients to participate under one [Strategy](/glossary/strategy).
