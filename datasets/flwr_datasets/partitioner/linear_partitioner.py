    The amount of data each client gets is linearly correlated with the partition ID.
    For instance, if the IDs range from 1 to M, client with ID 1 gets 1 unit of data,
    client 2 gets 2 units, and so on, up to client M which gets M units.

    ----------
    num_partitions : int
        The total number of partitions that the data will be divided into.
