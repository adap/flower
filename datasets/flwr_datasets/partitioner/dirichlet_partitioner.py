class DirichletPartitioner(Partitioner):
    """Partitioner based on Dirichlet distribution.

    Implementation based on Bayesian Nonparametric Federated Learning of Neural Networks
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12022.

    The algorithm sequentially divides the data with each label. The fractions of the
    data with each label is drawn from Dirichlet distribution and adjusted in case of
    balancing. The data is assigned. In case the `min_partition_size` is not satisfied
    the algorithm is run again (the fractions will change since it is a random process
    even though the alpha stays the same).

    The notion of balancing is explicitly introduced here (not mentioned in paper but
    implemented in the code). It is a mechanism that excludes the partition from
    assigning new samples to it if the current number of samples on that partition
    exceeds the average number that the partition would get in case of even data
    distribution. It is controlled by`self_balancing` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_partitions : int
        The total number of partitions that the data will be divided into.
    partition_by : str
        Column name of the labels (targets) based on which Dirichlet sampling works.
    alpha : Union[int, float, List[float], NDArrayFloat]
        Concentration parameter to the Dirichlet distribution
    min_partition_size : int
        The minimum number of samples that each partitions will have (the sampling
        process is repeated if any partition is too small).
    self_balancing : bool
        Whether assign further samples to a partition after the number of samples
        exceeded the average number of samples per partition. (True in the original
        paper's code although not mentioned in paper itself).
    shuffle: bool
        Whether to randomize the order of samples. Shuffling applied after the
        samples assignment to partitions.
    seed: int
        Seed used for dataset shuffling. It has no effect if `shuffle` is False.

    Examples
