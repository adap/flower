class ExponentialPartitioner(SizePartitioner):
    """Partitioner creates partitions of size that are correlated with exp(node_id).

    The amount of data each client gets is correlated with the exponent of partition ID.
    For instance, if the IDs range from 1 to M, client with ID 1 gets e units of
    data, client 2 gets e^2 units, and so on, up to client M which gets e^M units.
    The floor operation is applied on each of these numbers, it means floor(2.71...)
    = 2; e^2 ~ 7.39 floor(7.39) = 7. The number is rounded down = the fraction is
    always cut. The remainders of theses unassigned (fraction) samples is added to the
    biggest partition (the one with the biggest node_id).

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_partitions : int
        The total number of partitions that the data will be divided into.
