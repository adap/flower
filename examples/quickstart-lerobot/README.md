# Federated Learning with HuggingFace LeRobot and Flower (Quickstart Example)

This is an introductory example to using [ðŸ¤—LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/lerobot) with [ðŸŒ¼Flower](https://flower.ai/). It demonstrates that it is feasible to collaboratively train a robotics AI model in remote environments with their local data and then aggregated it in a shared model.

In this example, we will federate the training of a [Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04137) policy on the [PushT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lerobot/pusht/tree/v1.3) dataset. The data will be downloaded and partitioned using [Flower Datasets](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/). This example runs best when a GPU is available.

## Set up the project

### Clone the project

Start by cloning the example project. We prepared a single-line command that you can copy into your shell which will checkout the example for you:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adap/flower.git _tmp \
		&& mv _tmp/examples/quickstart-lerobot . \
		&& rm -rf _tmp && cd quickstart-lerobot
```

This will create a new directory called `quickstart-lerobot` containing the following files:

```shell
quickstart-lerobot
â”œâ”€â”€ lerobot_example
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task.py         # Defines your model, training and data loading
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lerobot_federated_dataset.py   # Defines the dataset
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lerobot_dataset_partitioner.py # Defines the dataset partitioner
|   â””â”€â”€ configs/		# configuration files
â”‚ 		â”œâ”€â”€ env/        	# gym environment config
|   	â”œâ”€â”€ policy/			# policy config
|   	â””â”€â”€ default.yaml 	# default config settings
|
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Install dependencies and project

Install the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` as well as the `lerobot_example` package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Choose training parameters

You can leave the default parameters for an initial quick test. However for good results, total number of training rounds should be at least 100,000. For example 
`num-server-rounds=500` and `local_epochs=200`.

## Run the Example

You can run your Flower project in both _simulation_ and _deployment_ mode without making changes to the code. If you are starting with Flower, we recommend you using the _simulation_ mode as it requires fewer components to be launched manually. By default, `flwr run` will make use of the Simulation Engine.

### Run with the Simulation Engine

> \[!TIP\]
> This example runs faster when the `ClientApp`s have access to a GPU. If your system has one, you can make use of it by configuring the `backend.client-resources` component in `pyproject.toml`. If you want to try running the example with GPU right away, use the `local-simulation-gpu` federation as shown below.

```bash
# Run with the default federation (CPU only)
flwr run .
```

Run the project in the `local-simulation-gpu` federation that gives CPU and GPU resources to each `ClientApp`. By default, at most 4x`ClientApp` (using ~2 GB of VRAM each) will run in parallel in each available GPU. Note you can adjust the degree of paralellism but modifying the `client-resources` specification. Running with the settings as in the `pyprojec.toml` takes 1h in a 2x RTX3090 machine.

```bash
# Run with the `local-simulation-gpu` federation
flwr run . local-simulation-gpu
```

You can also override some of the settings for your `ClientApp` and `ServerApp` defined in `pyproject.toml`. For example

```bash
flwr run --run-config "num-server-rounds=5 fraction-fit=0.1"
```

### Result output

Results of training steps for each client and server logs will be under the `outputs/` directory. For each run there will be a subdirectory corresponding to the date and time of the run. For example:

```shell
outputs/date_time/
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluate  # Each subdirectory contains .mp4 renders generated by clients
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ round_5	# Evaluations in a given round
|	|   â”œâ”€â”€ client_3
|	|	...	â””â”€â”€ rollout_20241207-105418.mp4 # render .mp4 for client at a given round
|	|	â””â”€â”€ client_1
|   ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ round_n   	# local client model checkpoint
â””â”€â”€ global_model # Each subdirectory contains global model of a round
	â”œâ”€â”€ round_1
	...
	â””â”€â”€ round_n
```

<!-- Earlier in the training cycles, rollouts will show that client evaluations are struggling to complete the task. See example below:

However later on after about 20,000 cumulative training cycles, which is (server rounds) X (local epochs) X (clients sampled to train in each server round), 
all clients begin to show progress and solve the pusht task. Example follows:
