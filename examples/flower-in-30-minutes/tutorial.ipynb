This is achieved via the `Virtual Client Engine`, the core component that runs [FL Simulations](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) with Flower. With simulation, you can dynamically scale your experiments whether you run the code on your laptop, a machine with a single GPU, a server with multiple GPUs os even on a cluster with multiple servers. The `Virtual Client Engine` handles everything transparently and it allows you to specify how many resources (e.g. CPU cores, GPU VRAM) should be assigned to each virtual client."

The caveat is that the model is being trained _collaboratively_ in Federation by multiple clients (sometimes up to hundreds of thousands) and, in most instances of FL, is sent by a central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Flower Client is a simple Python class with four distinct methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fit()`: With this method, the client does on-device training for a number of epochs using its own data. At the end, the resulting model is sent back to the server for aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `evaluate()`: With this method, the server can evaluate the performance of the global model on the local validation set of a client. This can be used for instance when there is no centralised dataset on the server for validation/test. Also, this method can be use to asses the degree of personalisation of the model being federated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `set_parameters()`: This method takes the parameters sent by the server and uses them to initialise the parameters of the local model that is ML framework specific (e.g. TF, Pytorch, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_parameters()`: It extract the parameters from the local model and transforms them into a list of NumPy arrays. This ML framework-agnostic representation of the model will be sent to the server.\n",

And it is true!! In Federated Learning, the way clients perform local training makes use of the same principles as more traditional centralised setup. The key difference is that the dataset now is much smaller and it's never _\"seen\"_ by the entity running the FL workload (i.e. the central server).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about the central server... we should define what strategy we want to make use of so the updated models sent from the clients back to the server at the end of the `fit()` method are aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chosing a Flower Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy sits at the core of the Federated Learning experiment. It is involved in all stages of a FL pipeline: sampling clients; sending the _global model_ to the clients so they can do `fit()`; receive the updated models from the clients and **aggregate** these to construct a new _global model_; define and execute global or federated evaluation; and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flower comes with [many strategies built-in](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/src/py/flwr/server/strategy) and more to be available in the next release (`1.5` already!). For this tutorial, let's use what is arguable the most popular strategy out there: `FedAvg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way `FedAvg` works is simple but performs surprisingly well in practice. It is therefore one good strategy to start your experimentation. `FedAvg`, as its name implies, derives a new version of the _global model_ by taking the average of all the models sent by clients participating in the round. You can read all the details [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can define `FedAvg` using Flower. We use one of the callbacks called `evaluate_fn` so we can easily evaluate the state of the global model using a small centralised testset. Note this functionality is user-defined since it requires a choice in terms of ML-framework. (if you recall, Flower is framework agnostic).\n",
    "\n",
    "> This being said, centralised evaluation of the global model is only possible if there exists a centralised dataset that somewhat follows a similar distribution as the data that's spread across clients. In some cases having such centralised dataset for validation is not possible, so the only solution is to federate the evaluation of the _global model_. This is the default behaviour in Flower. If you don't specify teh `evaluate_fn` argument in your strategy, then, centralised global evaluation won't be performed."
