# Federated Learning with NumPy and Flower (Quickstart Example)

This example of Flower uses a dummy `NumPy` model as well as dummy training and evaluation steps in the `ClientApp` to showcase the core functionality of Flower apps. This app does not use a dataset.

## Set up the project

### Fetch the app

Install Flower:

```shell
pip install flwr
```

Fetch the app:

```shell
flwr new @flwrlabs/quickstart-numpy
```

```shell
quickstart-numpy
├── quickstart_numpy
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp
│   ├── server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp
│   └── task.py         # Defines model creation
├── pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
└── README.md
```

### Install dependencies and project

Install the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` as well as the `quickstart_numpy` package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> **Tip:** Your `pyproject.toml` file can define more than just the dependencies of your Flower app. You can also use it to specify hyperparameters for your runs and control which Flower Runtime is used. By default, it uses the Simulation Runtime, but you can switch to the Deployment Runtime when needed.
> Learn more in the [TOML configuration guide](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-configure-pyproject-toml.html).

## Run with the Simulation Engine

In the `quickstart-numpy` directory, use `flwr run` to run a local simulation:

```bash
flwr run .
```

Refer to the [How to Run Simulations](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) guide in the documentation for advice on how to optimize your simulations.

## Run with the Deployment Engine

Follow this [how-to guide](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-flower-with-deployment-engine.html) to run the same app in this example but with Flower's Deployment Engine. After that, you might be interested in setting up [secure TLS-enabled communications](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-enable-tls-connections.html) and [SuperNode authentication](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-authenticate-supernodes.html) in your federation.

You can run Flower on Docker too! Check out the [Flower with Docker](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/docker/index.html) documentation.
