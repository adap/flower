# Platform configuration files define where and how runners run MLCubes. This configuration file defines a Docker
# runtime for MLCubes. One field needs to be updated here - `container.image`. This platform file defines local docker
# execution environment.
# MLCube Docker runner uses image name to either `pull` or `build` a docker image. The rule is the following:
#   - If the following file exists (`build/Dockerfile`), Docker image will be built.
#   - Else, docker runner will pull a docker image with the specified name.
# Users provide platform files using `--platform` command line argument.
