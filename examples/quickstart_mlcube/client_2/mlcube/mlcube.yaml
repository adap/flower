# This YAML file marks a directory to be an MLCube directory. When running MLCubes with runners, MLCube path is
# specified using `--mlcube` runner command line argument.
# The most important parameters that are defined here are (1) name, (2) author and (3) list of MLCube tasks.

# List of MLCube tasks supported by this MLCube (list of strings). Every task:
#    - Has a unique name (e.g. "download").
#    - Is defined in a YAML file in the `tasks` sub-folder (e.g. "tasks/download.yaml").
#    - Task name is passed to an MLCube implementation file as the first argument (e.g. "python mnist.py download ...").
# Every task is described by lists of input and output parameters. Every parameter is a file system path (directory or
# file) characterized by two fields - name and value.
# By default, if a file system path is a relative path (i.e. does not start with `/`), it is considered to be relative
# to the `workspace` sub-folder.
# Once all tasks are listed below, create a YAML file for each task in the 'tasks' sub-folder and change them
# appropriately.
# NEXT: study `tasks/example_task.yaml`.
