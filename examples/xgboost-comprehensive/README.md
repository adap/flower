# Federated Learning with XGBoost and Flower (Comprehensive Example)

This example demonstrates a comprehensive federated learning setup using Flower with XGBoost.
We use [HIGGS](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/280/higgs) dataset to perform a binary classification task. This examples uses [Flower Datasets](https://flower.ai/docs/datasets/) to retrieve, partition and preprocess the data for each Flower client.
It differs from the [xgboost-quickstart](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/xgboost-quickstart) example in the following ways:

- Customised FL settings.
- Customised partitioner type (uniform, linear, square, exponential).
- Centralised/distributed evaluation.
- Bagging/cyclic training methods.
- Support of scaled learning rate.

## Training Strategies

This example provides two training strategies, [**bagging aggregation**](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ref-api/flwr.serverapp.strategy.FedXgbBagging.html) and [**cyclic training**](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ref-api/flwr.server.strategy.FedXgbCyclic.html).

### Bagging Aggregation

Bagging (bootstrap) aggregation is an ensemble meta-algorithm in machine learning,
used for enhancing the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms.
Here, we leverage this algorithm for XGBoost trees.

Specifically, each client is treated as a bootstrap by random subsampling (data partitioning in FL).
At each FL round, all clients boost a number of trees (in this example, 1 tree) based on the local bootstrap samples.
Then, the clients' trees are aggregated on the server, and concatenates them to the global model from previous round.
The aggregated tree ensemble is regarded as a new global model.

This way, let's consider a scenario with M clients.
Given FL round R, the bagging models consist of (M * R) trees.

### Cyclic Training

Cyclic XGBoost training performs FL in a client-by-client fashion.
Instead of aggregating multiple clients,
there is only one single client participating in the training per round in the cyclic training scenario.
The trained local XGBoost trees will be passed to the next client as an initialised model for next round's boosting.

## Set up the project

### Clone the project

Start by cloning the example project:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adap/flower.git _tmp \
        && mv _tmp/examples/xgboost-comprehensive . \
        && rm -rf _tmp \
        && cd xgboost-comprehensive
```

This will create a new directory called `xgboost-comprehensive` with the following structure:

```shell
xgboost-comprehensive
├── xgboost_comprehensive
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp
│   ├── server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp
│   └── task.py         # Defines your model, training and data loading
├── pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
└── README.md
```

### Install dependencies and project

Install the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` as well as the `xgboost_comprehensive` package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Run the project

You can run your Flower project in both _simulation_ and _deployment_ mode without making changes to the code. If you are starting with Flower, we recommend you using the _simulation_ mode as it requires fewer components to be launched manually. By default, `flwr run` will make use of the Simulation Engine.

### Run with the Simulation Engine

> [!NOTE]
> Check the [Simulation Engine documentation](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) to learn more about Flower simulations and how to optimize them.

```bash
flwr run .
```

You can also override some of the settings for your `ClientApp` and `ServerApp` defined in `pyproject.toml`. For example:

```bash
# To run bagging aggregation for 5 rounds evaluated on centralised test set
flwr run . --run-config "train-method='bagging' num-server-rounds=5 centralised-eval=true"

# To run cyclic training with linear partitioner type evaluated on centralised test set:
flwr run . --run-config "train-method='cyclic' partitioner-type='linear' centralised-eval-client=true"
```

### Run with the Deployment Engine

Follow this [how-to guide](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-flower-with-deployment-engine.html) to run the same app in this example but with Flower's Deployment Engine. After that, you might be intersted in setting up [secure TLS-enabled communications](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-enable-tls-connections.html) and [SuperNode authentication](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-authenticate-supernodes.html) in your federation.

If you are already familiar with how the Deployment Engine works, you may want to learn how to run it using Docker. Check out the [Flower with Docker](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/docker/index.html) documentation.

## Expected Experimental Results

### Bagging aggregation experiment

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="_static/xgboost_flower_auc_bagging.png" alt="XGBoost with Flower and Bagging strategy" width="700"/>
</div>

The figure above shows the centralised tested AUC performance over FL rounds with bagging aggregation strategy on 4 experimental settings.
One can see that all settings obtain stable performance boost over FL rounds (especially noticeable at the start of training).
As expected, uniform client distribution shows higher AUC values than square/exponential setup.

### Cyclic training experiment

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="_static/xgboost_flower_auc_cyclic.png" alt="XGBoost with Flower and Cyclic strategy" width="700"/>
</div>

This figure shows the cyclic training results on centralised test set.
The models with cyclic training requires more rounds to converge
because only a single client participate in the training per round.

Feel free to explore more interesting experiments by yourself !
