# ``flwr``

Seamlessly integrate Flower federated AI framework into your existing machine learning project.

## Overview

Flower Swift client SDK provides tools and functionalities for federating your machine learning project easily using Flower. The framework provides protocol to create a Flower ``Client``, and a default ``MLFlwrClient`` implementation that uses CoreML as its local training pipeline. You can create your own custom Flower clients by conforming to the provided protocol.

You can connect to a Flower server using GRPC by instantiating ``FlwrGRPC`` and providing a correct hostname and port. To start a gRPC connection, you can call the function ``FlwrGRPC/startFlwrGRPC(client:)`` and provide a ``Client`` as its argument.
