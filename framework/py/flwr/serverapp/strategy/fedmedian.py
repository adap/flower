    Parameters
    ----------
    fraction_train : float (default: 1.0)
        Fraction of nodes used during training. In case `min_train_nodes`
        is larger than `fraction_train * total_connected_nodes`, `min_train_nodes`
        will still be sampled.
    fraction_evaluate : float (default: 1.0)
        Fraction of nodes used during validation. In case `min_evaluate_nodes`
        is larger than `fraction_evaluate * total_connected_nodes`,
        `min_evaluate_nodes` will still be sampled.
    min_train_nodes : int (default: 2)
        Minimum number of nodes used during training.
    min_evaluate_nodes : int (default: 2)
        Minimum number of nodes used during validation.
    min_available_nodes : int (default: 2)
        Minimum number of total nodes in the system.
    weighted_by_key : str (default: "num-examples")
        The key within each MetricRecord whose value is used as the weight when
        computing weighted averages for MetricRecords.
    arrayrecord_key : str (default: "arrays")
        Key used to store the ArrayRecord when constructing Messages.
    configrecord_key : str (default: "config")
        Key used to store the ConfigRecord when constructing Messages.
    train_metrics_aggr_fn : Optional[callable] (default: None)
        Function with signature (list[RecordDict], str) -> MetricRecord,
        used to aggregate MetricRecords from training round replies.
        If `None`, defaults to `aggregate_metricrecords`, which performs a weighted
        average using the provided weight factor key.
    evaluate_metrics_aggr_fn : Optional[callable] (default: None)
        Function with signature (list[RecordDict], str) -> MetricRecord,
        used to aggregate MetricRecords from training round replies.
        If `None`, defaults to `aggregate_metricrecords`, which performs a weighted
        average using the provided weight factor key.
