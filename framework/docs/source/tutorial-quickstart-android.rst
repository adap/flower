    :description: Read this Federated Learning quickstart tutorial for creating an Android app using Flower.

.. warning::

    The experimental Flower Android SDK is not compatible with the latest version of
    Flower. Android support is currently being reworked and will be released in 2025.

    This quickstart tutorial is kept for historical purposes and will be updated once
    the new Android SDK is released.

Let's build a federated learning system using TFLite and Flower on Android!
