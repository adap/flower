 What is Federated Learning?
#############################

Welcome to the Flower federated learning tutorial!

In this tutorial, you will learn what federated learning is, build your first system in
Flower, and gradually extend it. If you work through all parts of the tutorial, you will
be able to build advanced federated learning systems that approach the current state of
the art in the field.

🧑‍🏫 This tutorial starts from zero and expects no familiarity with federated learning.
Only a basic understanding of data science and Python programming is assumed.

Let's get started!

****************************
 Classical Machine Learning
****************************

Before we begin discussing federated learning, let us quickly recap how most machine
learning works today.

In machine learning, we have a model, and we have data. The model could be a neural
network (as depicted here), or something else, like classical linear regression.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <img src="_static/tutorial/model-and-data.png" alt="Model and data"/>
    </div>

We train the model using the data to perform a useful task. A task could be to detect
objects in images, transcribe an audio recording, or play a game like Go.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <img src="_static/tutorial/train-model.png" alt="Train model using data"/>
    </div>

In practice, the training data we work with doesn't originate on the machine we train
the model on.

This data gets created “somewhere else”. For instance, the data can originate on a
smartphone by the user interacting with an app, a car collecting sensor data, a laptop
receiving input via the keyboard, or a smart speaker listening to someone trying to sing
a song.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <img src="_static/tutorial/data-on-phone.png" alt="Data on a phone"/>
    </div>

What's also important to mention, this “somewhere else” is usually not just one place,
it's many places. It could be several devices all running the same app. But it could
also be several organizations, all generating data for the same task.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <img
      src="_static/tutorial/many-devices-with-data.png" alt="Data is on many devices"
      />
    </div>

So to use machine learning, or any kind of data analysis, the approach that has been
used in the past was to collect all this data on a central server. This server can be
located somewhere in a data center, or somewhere in the cloud.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <img src="_static/tutorial/collect-data.png" alt="Central data collection"/>
    </div>

Once all the data is collected in one place, we can finally use machine learning
algorithms to train our model on the data. This is the machine learning approach that
we've basically always relied on.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      <img
      src="_static/tutorial/central-model-training.png" alt="Central model training"
      />
    </div>

******************************************
 Challenges of classical machine learning
******************************************

This classical machine learning approach we've just seen can be used in some cases.
Great examples include categorizing holiday photos, or analyzing web traffic. Cases,
where all the data is naturally available on a centralized server.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img src="_static/tutorial/centralized-possible.png" alt="Centralized possible"/>
    </div>

But the approach can not be used in many other cases. Cases, where the data is not
available on a centralized server, or cases where the data available on one server is
not enough to train a good model.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img
    src="_static/tutorial/centralized-impossible.png" alt="Centralized impossible"
    />
    </div>

There are many reasons why the classical centralized machine learning approach does not
work for a large number of highly important real-world use cases. Those reasons include:

- **Regulations**: GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), PIPEDA (Canada), LGPD (Brazil),
  PDPL (Argentina), KVKK (Turkey), POPI (South Africa), FSS (Russia), CDPR (China), PDPB
  (India), PIPA (Korea), APPI (Japan), PDP (Indonesia), PDPA (Singapore), APP
  (Australia), and other regulations protect sensitive data from being moved. In fact,
  those regulations sometimes even prevent single organizations from combining their own
  users' data for machine learning training because those users live in different parts
  of the world, and their data is governed by different data protection regulations.
- **User preference**: In addition to regulation, there are use cases where users just
  expect that no data leaves their device, ever. If you type your passwords and credit
  card info into the digital keyboard of your phone, you don't expect those passwords to
  end up on the server of the company that developed that keyboard, do you? In fact,
  that use case was the reason federated learning was invented in the first place.
- **Data volume**: Some sensors, like cameras, produce such a high data volume that it
  is neither feasible nor economic to collect all the data (due to, for example,
  bandwidth or communication efficiency). Think about a national rail service with
  hundreds of train stations across the country. If each of these train stations is
  outfitted with a number of security cameras, the volume of raw on-device data they
  produce requires incredibly powerful and exceedingly expensive infrastructure to
  process and store. And most of the data isn't even useful.

Examples where centralized machine learning does not work include:

- Sensitive healthcare records from multiple hospitals to train cancer detection models.
- Financial information from different organizations to detect financial fraud.
- Location data from your electric car to make better range prediction.
- End-to-end encrypted messages to train better auto-complete models.

The popularity of privacy-enhancing systems like the `Brave <https://brave.com/>`__
browser or the `Signal <https://signal.org/>`__ messenger shows that users care about
privacy. In fact, they choose the privacy-enhancing version over other alternatives, if
such an alternative exists. But what can we do to apply machine learning and data
science to these cases to utilize private data? After all, these are all areas that
would benefit significantly from recent advances in AI.

********************
 Federated Learning
********************

Federated Learning simply reverses this approach. It enables machine learning on
distributed data by moving the training to the data, instead of moving the data to the
training. Here's a one-liner explanation:

- Centralized machine learning: move the data to the computation
- Federated (machine) Learning: move the computation to the data

By doing so, Federated Learning enables us to use machine learning (and other data
science approaches) in areas where it wasn't possible before. We can now train excellent
medical AI models by enabling different hospitals to work together. We can solve
financial fraud by training AI models on the data of different financial institutions.
We can build novel privacy-enhancing applications (such as secure messaging) that have
better built-in AI than their non-privacy-enhancing alternatives. And those are just a
few of the examples that come to mind. As we deploy Federated Learning, we discover more
and more areas that can suddenly be reinvented because they now have access to vast
amounts of previously inaccessible data.

So how does Federated Learning work, exactly? Let's start with an intuitive explanation.

Federated learning in five steps
================================

Step 0: Initialize global model
-------------------------------

We start by initializing the model on the server. This is exactly the same in classic
centralized learning: we initialize the model parameters, either randomly or from a
previously saved checkpoint.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img
    src="_static/tutorial/fl-initialize-global-model.png" alt="Initialize global model"
    />
    </div>

Step 1: Send model to a number of connected organizations/devices (client nodes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, we send the parameters of the global model to the connected client nodes (think:
edge devices like smartphones or servers belonging to organizations). This is to ensure
that each participating node starts its local training using the same model parameters.
We often use only a few of the connected nodes instead of all nodes. The reason for this
is that selecting more and more client nodes has diminishing returns.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img src="_static/tutorial/fl-send-global-model.png" alt="Send global model"/>
    </div>

Step 2: Train model locally on the data of each organization/device (client node)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that all (selected) client nodes have the latest version of the global model
parameters, they start the local training. They use their own local dataset to train
their own local model. They don't train the model until full convergence, but they only
train for a little while. This could be as little as one epoch on the local data, or
even just a few steps (mini-batches).

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img src="_static/tutorial/fl-local-training.png" alt="Train on local data"/>
    </div>

Step 3: Return model updates back to the server
-----------------------------------------------

After local training, each client node has a slightly different version of the model
parameters they originally received. The parameters are all different because each
client node has different examples in its local dataset. The client nodes then send
those model updates back to the server. The model updates they send can either be the
full model parameters or just the gradients that were accumulated during local training.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img src="_static/tutorial/fl-send-model-updates.png" alt="Send model updates"/>
    </div>

Step 4: Aggregate model updates into a new global model
-------------------------------------------------------

The server receives model updates from the selected client nodes. If it selected 100
client nodes, it now has 100 slightly different versions of the original global model,
each trained on the local data of one client. But didn't we want to have one model that
contains the learnings from the data of all 100 client nodes?

In order to get one single model, we have to combine all the model updates we received
from the client nodes. This process is called *aggregation*, and there are many
different ways to do it. The most basic way is called *Federated Averaging* (`McMahan et
al., 2016 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629>`__), often abbreviated as *FedAvg*.
*FedAvg* takes the 100 model updates and, as the name suggests, averages them. To be
more precise, it takes the *weighted average* of the model updates, weighted by the
number of examples each client used for training. The weighting is important to make
sure that each data example has the same “influence” on the resulting global model. If
one client has 10 examples, and another client has 100 examples, then - without
weighting - each of the 10 examples would influence the global model ten times as much
as each of the 100 examples.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img
    src="_static/tutorial/fl-aggregate-model-updates.png" alt="Aggregate model updates"
    />
    </div>

Step 5: Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the model converges
-----------------------------------------------------

Steps 1 to 4 are what we call a single round of federated learning. The global model
parameters get sent to the participating client nodes (step 1), the client nodes train
on their local data (step 2), they send their updated models to the server (step 3), and
the server then aggregates the model updates to get a new version of the global model
(step 4).

During a single round, each client node that participates in that iteration only trains
for a little while. This means that after the aggregation step (step 4), we have a model
that has been trained on all the data of all participating client nodes, but only for a
little while. We then have to repeat this training process over and over again to
eventually arrive at a fully trained model that performs well across the data of all
client nodes.

Conclusion
==========

Congratulations, you now understand the basics of federated learning. There's a lot more
to discuss, of course, but that was federated learning in a nutshell. In later parts of
this tutorial, we will go into more detail. Interesting questions include: How can we
select the best client nodes that should participate in the next round? What's the best
way to aggregate model updates? How can we handle failing client nodes (stragglers)?

Federated Evaluation
====================

Just like we can train a model on the decentralized data of different client nodes, we
can also evaluate the model on that data to receive valuable metrics. This is called
federated evaluation, sometimes abbreviated as FE. In fact, federated evaluation is an
integral part of most federated learning systems.

Federated Analytics
===================

In many cases, machine learning isn't necessary to derive value from data. Data analysis
can yield valuable insights, but again, there's often not enough data to get a clear
answer. What's the average age at which people develop a certain type of health
condition? Federated analytics enables such queries over multiple client nodes. It is
usually used in conjunction with other privacy-enhancing technologies like secure
aggregation to prevent the server from seeing the results submitted by individual client
nodes.

Differential Privacy
====================

Differential privacy (DP) is often mentioned in the context of Federated Learning. It is
a privacy-preserving method used when analyzing and sharing statistical data, ensuring
the privacy of individual participants. DP achieves this by adding statistical noise to
the model updates, ensuring any individual participants' information cannot be
distinguished or re-identified. This technique can be considered an optimization that
provides a quantifiable privacy protection measure.

Federated learning, federated evaluation, and federated analytics require infrastructure
to move machine learning models back and forth, train and evaluate them on local data,
and then aggregate the updated models. Flower provides the infrastructure to do exactly
that in an easy, scalable, and secure way. In short, Flower presents a unified approach
to federated learning, analytics, and evaluation. It allows the user to federate any
workload, any ML framework, and any programming language.
