##############################
 Configure ``pyproject.toml``
##############################

All Flower Apps need a ``pyproject.toml``. When you create a new Flower App using ``flwr
new``, a ``pyproject.toml`` file is generated. This file defines your app's
dependencies, and configuration setup.

A complete ``pyproject.toml`` file, for example, looks like this:

.. dropdown:: Example ``pyproject.toml``

    .. code-block:: toml

        [build-system]
        requires = ["hatchling"]
        build-backend = "hatchling.build"

        [project]
        name = "flower-app"
        version = "1.0.0"
        description = "A Flower app example"
        license = "Apache-2.0"
        dependencies = [
            "flwr[simulation]>=1.28.0",
            "numpy>=2.0.2",
        ]

        [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
        packages = ["."]

        [tool.flwr.app]
        publisher = "your-name-or-organization"
        fab-include = ["path/to/include_file.py"]  # Optional
        fab-exclude = ["path/to/exclude_file.py"]  # Optional

        [tool.flwr.app.components]
        serverapp = "your_module.server_app:app"
        clientapp = "your_module.client_app:app"

        [tool.flwr.app.config]
        num-server-rounds = 3
        any-name-you-like = "any value supported by TOML"

Here are a few key sections to look out for:

*******************************
 App Metadata and Dependencies
*******************************

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    name = "your-flower-app-name"
    version = "1.0.0"
    description = ""
    license = "Apache-2.0"
    dependencies = [
        "flwr[simulation]>=1.28.0",
        "numpy>=2.0.2",
    ]

    [tool.flwr.app]
    publisher = "your-name-or-organization"
    fab-include = ["src/**/*.py", "conf/*.yaml"]    # Optional
    fab-exclude = ["src/scratch.py"]                # Optional

.. dropdown:: Understanding each field

    .. note::

        \* Required fields

        These fields follow the standard ``pyproject.toml`` metadata format, commonly used by tools like ``uv``, ``poetry``, and others. Flower reuses these for configuration and packaging.

    - ``name``\*: The name of your Flower app.
    - ``version``\*: The current version of your app, used for packaging and distribution. Must follow Semantic Versioning (e.g., "1.0.0").
    - ``description``: A short summary of what your app does.
    - ``license``: The license your app is distributed under (e.g., Apache-2.0).
    - ``dependencies``\*: A list of Python packages required to run your app.
    - ``publisher``\*: The name of the person or organization publishing the app.
    - ``fab-include``: A list of file paths to include in the Flower App Bundle.
    - ``fab-exclude``: A list of file paths to exclude from the Flower App Bundle.

Specify the metadata, including the app name, version, etc., in these sections. Add any
Python packages your app needs under ``dependencies``. These will be installed when you
run:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e .

**********************************
 Defining Included/Excluded Files
**********************************

The ``fab-include`` and ``fab-exclude`` fields let you control which files end up in
your Flower App Bundle (FAB) — the package that carries your application code to the
SuperLink and SuperNodes.

Both fields are optional. When omitted, Flower uses sensible built-in defaults that
include common source files (``*.py``, ``*.toml``, ``*.md``, ``*.yaml``, ``*.yml``,
``*.json``, ``*.jsonl``, and ``LICENSE``) while excluding virtual environments, build
artifacts, ``__pycache__`` directories, and test files.

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.flwr.app]
    fab-include = ["src/**/*.py", "conf/*.yaml"]    # Optional
    fab-exclude = ["src/scratch.py"]                # Optional

When you do specify ``fab-include`` or ``fab-exclude``, every pattern must match at
least one file — Flower will raise an error for unresolved patterns so you can catch
typos early. Patterns follow the same syntax as ``.gitignore``.

Flower applies filtering in two stages:

1. **Publish filter** — Files are first narrowed to supported types, and any patterns in
   your ``.gitignore`` are applied to remove ignored files.
2. **FAB filter** — Your ``fab-include`` and ``fab-exclude`` patterns are applied next,
   followed by non-overridable built-in constraints that enforce supported file types
   and exclude directories like ``.venv/`` or ``__pycache__/``.

In short, ``fab-include`` and ``fab-exclude`` give you fine-grained control *within* the
boundaries of what Flower supports. You cannot use them to include unsupported file
types (e.g., ``.txt``) — Flower will flag any such conflicts with a clear error message.

.. dropdown:: Example: bundling only your source package and a config file

    Suppose your project looks like this::

        my-flower-app/
        ├── pyproject.toml
        ├── README.md
        ├── conf/
        │   └── config.yaml
        └── your_module/
            ├── client_app.py
            ├── server_app.py
            └── scratch.py      ← you don't want this in the FAB

    Add the following to your ``pyproject.toml``:

    .. code-block:: toml

        [tool.flwr.app]
        publisher = "your-name-or-organization"
        fab-include = ["your_module/**/*.py", "conf/*.yaml"]
        fab-exclude = ["your_module/scratch.py"]

    When you run ``flwr build``, the FAB will contain ``pyproject.toml`, ``your_module/client_app.py``,
    ``your_module/server_app.py``, and ``conf/config.yaml`` — but not ``your_module/scratch.py`` or
    ``README.md``.

****************
 App Components
****************

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.flwr.app.components]
    serverapp = "your_module.server_app:app"
    clientapp = "your_module.client_app:app"

.. dropdown:: Understanding each field

    .. note::

        \* Required fields

    - ``serverapp``\*: The import path to your ``ServerApp`` object.
    - ``clientapp``\*: The import path to your ``ClientApp`` object.

These entries point to your ``ServerApp`` and ``ClientApp`` definitions, using the
format ``<module>:<object>``. Only update these import paths if you rename your modules
or the variables that reference your ``ServerApp`` or ``ClientApp``.

*******************
 App Configuration
*******************

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.flwr.app.config]
    num-server-rounds = 3
    any-name-you-like = "any value supported by TOML"

Define configuration values that should be available to your app at runtime. You can
specify any number of key-value pairs in this section. All the configuration values in
this section are optional.

Access these values in your code using ``context.run_config``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    server_rounds = context.run_config["num-server-rounds"]

.. tip::

    You can also override the ``run_config`` values by passing the ``--run-config`` flag
    followed by key-value pairs when executing ``flwr run``. See the
    |flwr_run_cli_link|_ for more details.

**************************
 Federation Configuration
**************************

.. note::

    What was previously called "federation config" for SuperLink connections in
    ``pyproject.toml`` has been renamed and moved. These settings are now **SuperLink
    connection configuration** and are defined in the Flower configuration file. Refer
    to the `Flower Configuration <ref-flower-configuration.html>`_ for more information.
