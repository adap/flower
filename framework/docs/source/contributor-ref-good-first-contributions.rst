Good first contributions
========================

We welcome contributions to Flower! However, it is not always easy to know where to
start. We therefore put together a few recommendations on where to start to increase
your chances of getting your PR accepted into the Flower codebase.

Where to start
--------------

In general, it is easier to get PR's accepted if they only touch non-core areas of the
codebase. Good candidates to get started are:

- Documentation: What's missing? What could be expressed more clearly?
- Open issues: Issues with the tag `good first issue
  <https://github.com/adap/flower/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_.
- Baselines: See below.
- Examples: See below.

Flower Baselines
----------------

If you are not familiar with Flower Baselines, please check our `contributing guide for
baselines <https://flower.ai/docs/baselines/how-to-contribute-baselines.html>`_.

Then take a look at the open `issues
<https://github.com/adap/flower/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+baseline%22>`_
for baseline requests. If you find a baseline that you'd like to work on, and it has no
assignees, feel free to assign it to yourself and get started!

If you don't find the baseline you'd like to work on, be sure to open a new issue with
the baseline request template!

Usage examples
--------------

We wish we had more time to write usage examples because they help users to get started
with building what they want. If you notice any missing examples that could help others,
feel free to contribute!
