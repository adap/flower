 [602] COMMON_TLS_NOT_SUPPORTED
################################

*************
 Description
*************

The ``flower-superexec``, ``flwr-serverapp``, ``flwr-simulation``, and
``flwr-clientapp`` do not currently support TLS, as they are assumed to be executed
within the same network as their respective long-running processes: ``flower-superlink``
and ``flower-supernode``. Please refer to the `Flower Network Communication
<../ref-flower-network-communication.html>`_ guide for further details.

****************
 How to Resolve
****************

Use the ``--insecure`` flag to proceed without TLS.
