[602] COMMON_TLS_NOT_SUPPORTED
==============================

Description
-----------

The ``flwr-serverapp`` and ``flwr-clientapp`` do not currently support TLS, as they are
assumed to be executed within the same network as their respective long-running
processes: ``flower-superlink`` and ``flower-supernode``. Please refer to the `Flower
Network Communication <../ref-flower-network-communication.html>`_ guide for further
details.

How to Resolve
--------------

Use the ``--insecure`` flag to proceed without TLS.
