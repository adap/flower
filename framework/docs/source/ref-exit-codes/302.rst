[302] SUPERNODE_NODE_AUTH_KEYS_INVALID
======================================

Description
-----------

The provided key files are invalid. Authentication requires a valid elliptic curve
private and public key pair. This error occurs when either:

- The **private key** file specified in ``--auth-supernode-private-key`` is invalid or
  unreadable.
- The **public key** file specified in ``--auth-supernode-public-key`` is invalid or
  unreadable.

How to Resolve
--------------

1. Ensure that the file paths provided for the private and public key options are
   correct.

2. Verify that both files exist and contain valid elliptic curve ssh keys. - The private
key file should be in a format compatible with elliptic curve cryptography. - The public
key file should match the private key.

3. If the files are corrupted or not in the correct format, regenerate the elliptic
curve ssh key pair and update the file paths accordingly. For example, in Linux/MacOS,
**for rapid prototyping only** (not production; follow company procedures for key
management):

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 384 -N "" -f id_ecdsa_nistp384
