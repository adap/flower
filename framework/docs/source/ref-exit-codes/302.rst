[302] SUPERNODE_NODE_AUTH_KEY_INVALID
=====================================

Description
-----------

Authentication requires a valid elliptic curve private key. This error occurs when the
provided private key file specified in ``--auth-supernode-private-key`` is invalid or
unreadable.

How to Resolve
--------------

1. Ensure that the file path provided for the private key option is correct.
2. Verify that the file exists and contains a valid elliptic curve SSH key.
3. If the files are corrupted or not in the correct format, regenerate the elliptic
   curve SSH key pair and update the file paths accordingly. For example, on Linux or
   macOS, **for rapid prototyping only** (not production; follow company procedures for
   key management):

   .. code-block:: bash

       ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 384 -N "" -f id_ecdsa_nistp384
