[302] SUPERNODE_NODE_AUTH_KEYS_INVALID
======================================

Description
-----------

The provided key files are invalid. Authentication requires a valid elliptic curve
private and public key pair. This error occurs when either:

- The **private key** file specified in ``--auth-supernode-private-key`` is invalid or
  unreadable.
- The **public key** file specified in ``--auth-supernode-public-key`` is invalid or
  unreadable.

How to Resolve
--------------

1. Ensure that the file paths provided for the private and public key options are
   correct.

2. Verify that both files exist and contain valid elliptic curve keys. - The private key
file should be in a format compatible with elliptic curve cryptography. - The public key
file should match the private key.

3. If the files are corrupted or not in the correct format, regenerate the elliptic
curve key pair and update the file paths accordingly. For example, in Linux/MacOS, **for
rapid prototyping only** (not production; follow company procedures for key management):

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl ecparam-genkey -name secp384r1 -out private_key.pem
    openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
