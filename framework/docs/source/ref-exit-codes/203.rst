 [203] SERVERAPP_RUN_START_REJECTED
####################################

*************
 Description
*************

The SuperLink rejected the request to start the run. This may occur if the run has been
stopped, the run failed to start within the allowed time, or the run ID or FAB is
invalid.

****************
 How to Resolve
****************

1. Check if the run has been stopped by another process or user.
2. Verify that the SuperExec can start the ServerApp within the allowed time. Slow
   imports in the ServerApp may cause timeouts.
3. Ensure the SuperLink database is in the correct state and not corrupted.
