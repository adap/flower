 [105] SUPERLINK_DATABASE_SCHEMA_MISMATCH
##########################################

*************
 Description
*************

The SuperLink was started with a database schema that does not match the expected
baseline schema.

This typically occurs when using a pre-Alembic database that requires migration that has
been modified.

****************
 How to Resolve
****************

Back up your database and either migrate it manually to the baseline schema or start
with a fresh database.
