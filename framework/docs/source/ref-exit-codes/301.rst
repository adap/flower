[301] SUPERNODE_NODE_AUTH_KEYS_REQUIRED
=======================================

Description
-----------

To run the SuperNode with authentication, file paths for both the private and public
keys must be provided. Specifically, the following options must be specified:

- ``--auth-supernode-private-key``
- ``--auth-supernode-public-key``

Providing only one of these options is insufficient for authentication.

How to Resolve
--------------

1. Ensure that the paths to both the private key and public key files are specified in
command-line arguments. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    --auth-supernode-private-key /path/to/private_key.pem
    --auth-supernode-public-key /path/to/public_key.pem

2. Verify that the specified file paths are correct and that the files exist.
