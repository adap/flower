[303] SUPERNODE_STARTED_WITHOUT_TLS_BUT_NODE_AUTH_ENABLED
=========================================================

Description
-----------

The private key for SuperNode authentication was provided, but TLS is not enabled.
SuperNode authentication requires a secure TLS connection with the SuperLink.

How to Resolve
--------------

To resolve this issue you need to either:

- Enable TLS by providing the required TLS certificates when launching the SuperNode.

  .. code-block:: bash
      :emphasize-lines: 2

      $ flower-supernode \
          --root-certificates path/to/your/ca.crt \
          --superlink=<superlink-address>

  Please refer to the documentation on `how to enable TLS in SuperNode
  <../how-to-enable-tls-connections.rst>`_ for more details.

- If you are prototyping, you may disable the CLI-managed SuperNode authentication
  mechanism by removing the private key argument when launching the SuperNode. This will
  make your SuperNode use the automatic authentication mechanism.

Read more about both SuperNode authentication modes in the documentation on `how to
authenticate SuperNodes <../how-to-authenticate-supernodes.rst>`_.
