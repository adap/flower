[500] FLWRCLI_NODE_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY_INVALID
==========================================

Description
-----------

The provided public key file is invalid. Authentication requires a valid elliptic curve
public key in the ssh format. This error occurs when either:

- The public key file specified passed to `flwr supernode create` is invalid or
  unreadable.

How to Resolve
--------------

1. Ensure that the file path provided for the public key option is correct.
2. Verify that the file exists and contains a valid ECDSA public key in SSH format with
   a standard elliptic curve following the NIST specifications (e.g. SECP384R1).

3. If the files are corrupted or not in the correct format, regenerate the elliptic
curve key pair and update the file paths accordingly. For example, in Linux/MacOS, **for
rapid prototyping only** (not production; follow company procedures for key management):

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 384 -N "" -f id_ecdsa_nistp384
