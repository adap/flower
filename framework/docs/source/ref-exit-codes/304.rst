[304] SUPERNODE_TRUST_ENTITY_REQUIRED
=====================================

Description
-----------

This error occurs when entity verification is enabled using the
``--enable-entities-verification`` flag, but no trusted entities have been provided. The
SuperNode should be restarted with a valid list of trusted entities.

How to Resolve
--------------

To fix this issue, you can either:

- Provide a trusted entities list. Supply a YAML file containing the trusted entities'
  public key IDs and their corresponding public keys when launching the SuperNode. The
  file should follow this format:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      alice-2025: |
        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        ...
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
      bob-2025: |
        -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        ...
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

- Disable entity verification. Remove the ``--enable-entities-verification`` flag when
  starting the SuperNode to run without entity verification.
