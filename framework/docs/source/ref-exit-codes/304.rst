[304] SUPERNODE_INVALID_TRUSTED_ENTITIES
========================================

Description
-----------

This error occurs when an invalid YAML file for trusted entities is provided via the
``--trusted-entities`` option. The SuperNode must be restarted with a valid trusted
entities list.

How to Resolve
--------------

To resolve this issue, you can do one of the following:

- **Provide a valid trusted entities list** using the ``--trusted-entities`` option when
  launching the SuperNode. Supply a YAML file (for example, ``--trusted-entities
  ./pks.yaml``) that contains the trusted entities’ public key IDs and their
  corresponding public keys.

  - Public keys must be in **OpenSSH format**, and currently only the **ssh-ed25519**
    key type is supported.
  - Public key IDs must follow the format ``fpk_<UUID>``, where ``fpk`` stands for
    Flower Public Key.
  - The YAML file should follow this structure:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        fpk_UUID1: ssh-ed25519 <base64-encoded-key1> [comment1]*
        fpk_UUID2: ssh-ed25519 <base64-encoded-key2> [comment2]*

    \*Comments are optional.

- **Disable entity verification** by removing the ``--trusted-entities`` option when
  starting the SuperNode. This allows the SuperNode to run without entity verification.
