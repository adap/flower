[304] SUPERNODE_TRUST_ENTITY_REQUIRED
=====================================

Description
-----------

This error occurs when entity verification is enabled using the
``--enable-entities-verification`` flag, but no trusted entities have been provided. The
SuperNode should be restarted with a valid list of trusted entities.

How to Resolve
--------------

To fix this issue, you can either:

- Provide a trusted entities list with ``--trust-entities`` when launching the
  SuperNode. Supply a YAML file (for example, ``--trust-entities ./pks.yaml``)
  containing the trusted entities’ public key IDs and their corresponding public keys.

  - The public keys must be in **OpenSSH format**, and currently only the
    **ssh-ed25519** key type is supported.
  - Public key IDs must follow the format ``fpk_<UUID>``, where ``fpk`` stands for
    Flower Public Key.
  - The YAML file should follow this structure:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      fpk_UUID1: ssh-ed25519 <base64-encoded-key1> [comment1]
      fpk_UUID2: ssh-ed25519 <base64-encoded-key2> [comment2]

- Disable entity verification. Remove the ``--enable-entities-verification`` flag when
  starting the SuperNode to run without entity verification.
