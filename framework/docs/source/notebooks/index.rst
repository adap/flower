    :description: Run the Flower Federated Learning Tutorial in Notebooks

Tutorial Notebooks
==================

Instead of following the main tutorials in the documentation, you can also run them in
interactive Jupyter notebooks. This allows you to execute code snippets and experiment
with running Flower in a more interactive way.

.. note::

    The notebooks use the ``run_simulation`` approach, but the preferred way to run
    simulations is using the ``flwr run`` approach. For a comprehensive guide on how to
    setup and run Flower simulations please read the `how-to run simulations
    <../how-to-run-simulations.html>`_ guide.

- `Get started with Flower and PyTorch
  <https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/framework/docs/source/notebooks/tutorial-series-get-started-with-flower-pytorch.ipynb>`_
- `Use a Federated Learning Strategy
  <https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/framework/docs/source/notebooks/tutorial-series-use-a-federated-learning-strategy-pytorch.ipynb>`_
- `Build a Strategy from Scratch
  <https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/framework/docs/source/notebooks/tutorial-series-build-a-strategy-from-scratch-pytorch.ipynb>`_
- `Customize the Client
  <https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/framework/docs/source/notebooks/tutorial-series-customize-the-client-pytorch.ipynb>`_

Additionally, you can follow the 30 mins notebook tutorial on `how to run Flower
simulation with PyTorch
<https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/flower-in-30-minutes>`_.
