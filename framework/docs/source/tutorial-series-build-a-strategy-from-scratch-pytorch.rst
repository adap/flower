Welcome to the third part of the Flower federated learning tutorial. In previous parts
of this tutorial, we introduced federated learning with PyTorch and the Flower framework
(:doc:`part 1 <tutorial-series-get-started-with-flower-pytorch>`) and we learned how
strategies can be used to customize the execution on both the server and the clients
(:doc:`part 2 <tutorial-series-use-a-federated-learning-strategy-pytorch>`).

In this tutorial, we'll continue to customize the federated learning system we built
previously by creating a much more customized version of ``FedAdagrad``.

Let's build a new ``Strategy`` with a customized |strategy_start_link|_ method üåº
enabling: the saving of the global model when a new best global accuracy is found; and
log the metrics generated during the run to Weights & Biases!

Preparation
-----------

Before we begin with the actual code, let's make sure that we have everything we need.

Installing dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    If you've completed part 1 and 2 of the tutorial, you can skip this step.

First, we install the Flower package ``flwr``:

.. code-block:: shell

    # In a new Python environment
    $ pip install -U "flwr[simulation]"

Then, we create a new Flower app called ``flower-tutorial`` using the PyTorch template.
We also specify a username (``flwrlabs``) for the project:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ flwr new flower-tutorial --framework pytorch --username flwrlabs

After running the command, a new directory called ``flower-tutorial`` will be created.
It should have the following structure:

.. code-block:: shell

    flower-tutorial
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flower_tutorial
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client_app.py   # Defines your ClientApp
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server_app.py   # Defines your ServerApp
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task.py         # Defines your model, training and data loading
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml      # Project metadata like dependencies and configs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

Next, add the `wandb` dependency to the project by editing the ``pyproject.toml`` file
located in the root of the project. Add the following line the list of dependencies

.. code-block:: shell

    "wandb>=0.17.8"

Next, we install the project and its dependencies, which are specified in the
``pyproject.toml`` file:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ cd flower-tutorial
    $ pip install -e .

.. note::

    If this is the first time you install ``wandb``, you might be asked to create an
    account and then log in to your system. You can start this process by typing this in
    your terminal:

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ wandb login

Customize the ``start`` method of a strategy
--------------------------------------------

Flower strategies have a number of methods that can be overwritten to customize their
behavior. In part-2 you learned how to customize the ``configure_train`` method to
perform learning rate decay and communicate the updated learning rate as part of the
|configrecord_link|_ sent to the clients in the ``Message``. In this tutorial you'll
learn how to customize the |strategy_start_link|_ method. If you inspect the `source
code
<https://github.com/adap/flower/blob/main/framework/py/flwr/serverapp/strategy/strategy.py#L135>`_
of this method you'll see that it contains a for loop where each iteration represents a
federated learning round. Each round is comprised of three distinct stages:

1. A training stage, where a subset of clients is selected to train the current global
   model on their local data.
2. An evaluation stage, where a subset of clients is selected to evaluate the updated
   global model on their local validation sets.
3. An optional stage to evaluate the global model on the server side. Note this is what
   you enabled in part-2 of this tutorial by means of the ``central_evaluate`` callback.

Let's extend the ``CustomFedAdagrad`` strategy we created earlier and introduce:

1. ``_update_best_acc``: An auxiliary method to save the global model whenever a new
   best accuracy is found.
2. ``set_save_path``: An auxiliary method to set the path where ``wandb`` logs and model
   checkpoints will be saved. This method will be called from the ``server_app.py``
   after instantiating the strategy.
3. A customized |strategy_start_link|_ method to log metrics to Weight & Biases (`W&B
   <https://wandb.ai/site>`__) and save the model checkpoints to disk.

            return result

With the extended ``CustomFedAdagrad`` strategy defined we need now to set the path
where the model checkpoints will be saved as well as the name of the runs in ``W&B``. We
need to call the ``set_save_path`` method after instantiating the strategy and before
calling the ``start`` method. In ``server_app.py``, we can create a new directory called
``results`` and then a subdirectory with the current timestamp to store the results of
each run. We can then call the ``set_save_path``. In this tutorial we create the
directory based on the current date and time, this means that each time you do ``flwr
run`` a new directory will be used. Let's see how this looks in code:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 22

    from datetime import datetime
    from pathlib import Path


    @app.main()
    def main(grid: Grid, context: Context) -> None:
        """Main entry point for the ServerApp."""

        # ... unchanged

        # Initialize FedAdagrad strategy
        # strategy = CustomFedAdagrad( ... )

        # Get the current date and time
        current_time = datetime.now()
        run_dir = current_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d/%H-%M-%S")
        # Save path is based on the current directory
        save_path = Path.cwd() / f"outputs/{run_dir}"
        save_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=False)

        # Set the path where results and model checkpoints will be saved
        strategy.set_save_path(save_path)

        # ... rest unchanged

Finally, let's run the ``FlowerApp``:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ flwr run .

After starting the run you will notice two things:

1. A new directory will be created in ``outputs/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS`` where
   ``YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS`` is the current date and time. This directory will contain the
   model checkpoints saved during the run. Recall a checkpoint is saved whenever a new
   best accuracy is found during the centralized evaluation stage.
2. A new run will be created in your `W&B project <https://wandb.ai/home>`_ where you
   can visualize the metrics logged during the run.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a custom Flower strategy by overwriting the
|strategy_start_link|_ method. You've also learned how to log metrics to Weight & Biases
and how to save model checkpoints to disk.

Recap
-----

In this tutorial, we've seen how to customize the |strategy_start_link|_ method of a
Flower strategy. This method is the main entry point of any strategy and contains the
logic to execute the federated learning process. In this tutorial you learned how to log
the metrics to Weight & Biases and how to save model checkpoints to disk.

In the next tutorial, we're going to cover how to communicate arbitrary Python objects
between the ``ClientApp`` and the ``ServerApp`` by serializing them and send them in a
``Message`` as a ``ConfigRecord``.
