This page collects answers to commonly asked questions about Federated Learning with
Flower.

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` Can Flower run on Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colab?

    Yes, it can! Flower even comes with a few under-the-hood optimizations to make it work even better on Colab. Here's a quickstart example:

    * `Flower simulation PyTorch <https://colab.research.google.com/github/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/simulation-pytorch/sim.ipynb>`_
    * `Flower simulation TensorFlow/Keras <https://colab.research.google.com/github/adap/flower/blob/main/examples/simulation-tensorflow/sim.ipynb>`_

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` How can I run Federated Learning on a Raspberry Pi?

    Find the `blog post about federated learning on embedded device here <https://flower.ai/blog/2020-12-16-running_federated_learning_applications_on_embedded_devices_with_flower>`_ and the corresponding `GitHub code example <https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded-devices>`_.

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` Does Flower support federated learning on Android devices?

    Yes, it does. Please take a look at our `blog post <https://flower.ai/blog/2021-12-15-federated-learning-on-android-devices-with-flower>`_ or check out the code examples:

    * `Android Kotlin example <https://flower.ai/docs/examples/android-kotlin.html>`_
    * `Android Java example <https://flower.ai/docs/examples/android.html>`_

.. dropdown:: :fa:`eye,mr-1` Can I combine federated learning with blockchain?

    Yes, of course. A list of available examples using Flower within a blockchain environment is available here:

    * `FLock: A Decentralised AI Training Platform <https://www.flock.io/#/>`_.
        * Contribute to on-chain training the model and earn rewards.
        * Local blockchain with federated learning simulation.
