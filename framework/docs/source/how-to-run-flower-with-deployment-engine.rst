 Run Flower with the Deployment Engine
#######################################

This how-to guide demonstrates how to set up and run Flower with the Deployment Engine
using minimal configurations to illustrate the workflow. This is a complementary guide
to the :doc:`docker/index` guides.

In this how-to guide, you will:

- Create a Flower App using PyTorch.
- Start a Flower federation consisting of one SuperLink ("the server") and two
  SuperNodes ("the clients").
- Run the Flower App on this federation.

The how-to guide should take less than 10 minutes to complete.

***************
 Prerequisites
***************

Before you start, make sure that:

- The latest ``flwr`` CLI version is installed on your machine. Follow the installation
  instructions :doc:`here <../how-to-install-flower>`.
- This guide assumes all commands to be executed in the same machine in different
  terminals, each making use of the same Python environment.
- This guide also assumes that you are familiar with the basic components in a Flower
  deployment (i.e. SuperLink and SuperNode), what their roles are and how they interact
  with each other. Please refer to the :doc:`explanation-flower-architecture` guide and
  the :doc:`ref-flower-network-communication` for an overview of what each component
  does and how they interact with each other.

.. note::

    In a real deployment you would typically run the SuperLink the SuperNodes in
    different machines/servers from the one you develop your Flower app (i.e. from where
    you do ``flwr new`` and ``flwr run``). The guide presented below is still valid for
    such scenarios but you will need to have setup a Python environment with the right
    set of dependencies for SuperLink and SuperNodes. An often easier way to achieve
    such deployments is by means of Docker. Check the :doc:`docker/index` to gain a
    better understanding on how to do so.

*****************************
 Step 1: Create a Flower App
*****************************

Although you could write a Flower app from scratch, it is often easier to start from one
of the available quickstart apps via ``flwr new`` and then customize it to your use
case. Create a new Flower app (PyTorch), and follow the instructions shown upon
executing ``flwr new``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flwr new @flwrlabs/quickstart-pytorch

    🔗 Requesting download link for @flwrlabs/quickstart-pytorch...
    🔽 Downloading ZIP into memory...
    📦 Unpacking into /Users/alice/quickstart-pytorch...
    🎊 Flower App creation successful.

    To run your Flower App, first install its dependencies:

            cd quickstart-pytorch && pip install -e .

    then, run the app:

            flwr run .

    💡 Check the README in your app directory to learn how to
    customize it and how to run it using the Deployment Runtime.

.. note::

    If you decide to run the project with ``flwr run .``, the Simulation Engine will be
    used. Continue to Step 2 to know how to instead use the Deployment Engine.

.. tip::

    Feel free to inspect the code using your favorite code editor before proceeding.
    Just open the ``quickstart-pytorch`` that was automatically created via ``flwr
    new``. If you would like to get an overview of the code that was generated, take a
    look at the :doc:`tutorial-quickstart-pytorch` tutorial.

**********************************
 Step 2: Launch Flower Federation
**********************************

In this section you will learn how to launch a SuperLink and connect two SuperNodes to
it.

Start a Flower SuperLink
========================

In a new terminal, activate your environment and start the SuperLink process in insecure
mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ flower-superlink --insecure

.. dropdown:: Understand the command

    * ``flower-superlink``: Name of the SuperLink installed CLI executable.
    * ``--insecure``: This flag tells the SuperLink to operate in an insecure mode, allowing
      unencrypted communication. Refer to the :doc:`how-to-enable-tls-connections` guide to learn how to run your SuperLink with TLS.

Start two Flower SuperNodes
===========================

In this step, you will launch two SuperNodes and connect them to the SuperLink. You will
need two terminals for this step.

.. note::

    Note that the values passed via the ``--node-config`` argument are specific to the
    behaviour of the ``ClientApp``. If you inspect the code generated in the first step
    via ``flwr new``, you'd see that the ``ClientApp`` is expecting a certain set of
    key-value pairs to be present in order to partition and load some data. Typically,
    your ``ClientApp`` wouldn't partition a dataset, instead it would access the data
    directly available. In such cases you would write your ``ClientApp`` and make it
    receive, for example, the path to a directory of images.

1. **Terminal 1** Start the first SuperNode after activating your environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ flower-supernode \
            --insecure \
            --superlink 127.0.0.1:9092 \
            --clientappio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9094 \
            --node-config "partition-id=0 num-partitions=2"

   .. dropdown:: Understand the command

       * ``flower-supernode``: Name of the SuperNode installed CLI executable.
       * ``--insecure``: This flag tells the SuperNode to operate in an insecure mode, allowing
         unencrypted communication. Refer to the :doc:`how-to-enable-tls-connections` guide to learn how to run your SuperNode with TLS.
       * ``--superlink 127.0.0.1:9092``: Connect to the SuperLink's Fleet API at the address
         ``127.0.0.1:9092``. If you had launched the SuperLink in a different machine, you'd replace ``127.0.0.1`` with the public IP of that machine.
       * ``--clientappio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9094``: Set the address and port number where the
         SuperNode is listening to communicate with the ``ClientApp``.
       * ``--node-config "partition-id=0 num-partitions=2"``: The ``ClientApp`` code generated via ``flwr new`` expects those two key-value pairs to be defined at run time. Set the partition ID to ``0`` and the number of partitions to ``2`` for the SuperNode configuration.

2. **Terminal 2** Start the second SuperNode after activating your environment:

   .. code-block:: shell

       $ flower-supernode \
            --insecure \
            --superlink 127.0.0.1:9092 \
            --clientappio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9095 \
            --node-config "partition-id=1 num-partitions=2"

   .. dropdown:: Understand the command

       * ``--clientappio-api-address 127.0.0.1:9095``: Note that a different port is being used. This is only needed because you are running two SuperNodes on the same machine. Typically you would run one node per machine and therefore, the ``--clientappio-api-address`` could be omitted all together and left with its default value.
       * ``--node-config "partition-id=1 num-partitions=2"``: Note here we indicate a different `partition-id`. In this way, a ``ClientApp`` will use a different data partition depending on which SuperNode runs in.

********************************************
 Step 3: Run a Flower App on the Federation
********************************************

.. note::

    The Flower Configuration file is automatically created for you when you first use a
    Flower CLI command. Use ``flwr config list`` to see available SuperLink connections
    as well as the path to the configuration file. Read more about it in the
    :doc:`ref-flower-configuration` guide.

At this point, you have launched two SuperNodes that are connected to the same
SuperLink. The system is idling waiting for a ``Run`` to be submitted. Before you can
run your Flower App through the federation we need a way to tell ``flwr run`` that the
App is to be executed via the SuperLink we just started, instead of using the local
Simulation Engine (the default). Doing this is easy: define a new SuperLink connection
in the **Flower Configuration** file, indicate the address of the SuperLink and pass a
certificate (if any) or set the insecure flag (only when testing locally, real
deployments require TLS).

1. Find the Flower Configuration TOML file in your machine. This file is automatically
   create for your when you first use a Flower CLI command. Use ``flwr config list`` to
   see available SuperLink connections as well as the path to the configuration file.

   .. code-block:: bash
       :emphasize-lines: 3

         $ flwr config list

         Flower Config file: /path/to/.flwr/config.toml
         SuperLink connections:
           supergrid
           local (default)

2. Open the ``config.toml`` file and at the end add a new SuperLink connection:

   .. code-block:: toml
       :caption: config.toml

       [superlink.local-deployment]
       address = "127.0.0.1:9093"
       insecure = true

   .. note::

       You can customize the string that follows ``[superlink.]`` to fit your needs.
       However, please note that the string cannot contain a dot (``.``).

       In this example, ``local-deployment`` has been used. Just remember to replace
       ``local-deployment`` with your chosen name in both the ``[superlink.]`` string
       and the corresponding ``flwr run .`` command.

3. In another terminal and with your Python environment activated, run the Flower App
   and follow the ``ServerApp`` logs to track the execution of the run:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ flwr run . local-deployment --stream

   If you want to rerun the project or test an updated version by making changes to the
   code, simply re-run the command above.

******************
 Step 4: Clean Up
******************

Use the ``Ctrl+C`` command in each terminal to stop the respective processes.
