"L'apprentissage fédéré, l'évaluation fédérée et l'analyse fédérée "
"nécessitent une infrastructure pour déplacer les modèles d'apprentissage "
"automatique dans les deux sens, les entraîner et les évaluer sur des "
"données locales, puis agréger les modèles mis à jour. Flower fournit "
"l'infrastructure pour faire exactement cela de manière simple, évolutive "

"l'apprentissage, de l'analyse et de l'évaluation fédérés. Il permet à "
"l'utilisateur de fédérer n'importe quelle charge de travail, n'importe "
"quel cadre de ML et n'importe quel langage de programmation."
