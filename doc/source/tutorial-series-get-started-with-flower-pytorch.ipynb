Each instance of `FlowerClient` represents a *single client* in our federated learning system. Federated learning systems have multiple clients (otherwise, there's not much to federate), so each client will be represented by its own instance of `FlowerClient`. If we have, for example, three clients in our workload, then we'd have three instances of `FlowerClient`. Flower calls `FlowerClient.fit` on the respective instance when the server selects a particular client for training (and `FlowerClient.evaluate` for evaluation).\n",

Flower calls `client_fn` whenever it needs an instance of one particular client to call `fit` or `evaluate` (those instances are usually discarded after use, so they should not keep any local state).

The last step is to start the actual simulation using `flwr.simulation.start_simulation`. \n",

The strategy encapsulates the federated learning approach/algorithm, for example, *Federated Averaging* (FedAvg).\n",

When the server receives the model parameter updates from the clients, it hands those updates over to the strategy (*FedAvg*) for aggregation.
