Contribute translations
=======================

Since `Flower 1.5
<https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ref-changelog.html#v1-5-0-2023-08-31>`_ we
have introduced translations to our doc pages, but, as you might have noticed,
the translations are often imperfect. If you speak languages other than
English, you might be able to help us in our effort to make Federated Learning
accessible to as many people as possible by contributing to those translations!
This might also be a great opportunity for those wanting to become open source
contributors with little prerequisites.

Our translation project is publicly available over on `Weblate
<https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/flower-docs/framework/>`_, this where most
of the work will happen.

Contribute to existing languages
--------------------------------

The first thing you will need to do in order to contribute is to create a
free Weblate account on this `page
<https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/>`_. More information
about profile settings can be found `here
<https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/profile.html>`_.

Once you are signed in to Weblate, you can navigate to the `Flower Framework
project <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/flower-docs/framework/>`_. Here,
you should see the different existing languages that can be found on the
website.

Once you have selected the language you want to contribute to, you should see a
similar interface to this:

The most straight forward option here is to click on the ``Translate`` button
on the top right (in the ``Translation status`` section). This will
automatically bring you to the translation interface for untranslated strings.

This is what the interface looks like:

You input your translation in the text box at the top and then, once you are
happy with it, you either press ``Save and continue`` (to save the translation
and go to the next untranslated string), ``Save and stay`` (to save the
translation and stay on the same page), ``Suggest`` (to add your translation to
suggestions for other users to view), or ``Skip`` (to go to the next
untranslated string without saving anything).

In order to help with the translations, you can see on the bottom the ``Nearby
strings``, the ``Comments`` (from other contributors), the ``Automatic
suggestions`` (from machine translation engines), the translations in ``Other
languages``, and the ``History`` of translations for this string.

On the right, under the ``String information`` section, you can also click the
link under ``Source string location`` in order to view the source of the doc
file containing the string.

For more information about translating using Weblate, you can check out this
`in-depth guide <https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/user/translating.html>`_.

Add new languages
-----------------

If you want to add a new language, you will first have to contact us, either on
`Slack <https://flower.ai/join-slack>`_, or by opening an issue on our `GitHub
repo <https://github.com/adap/flower>`_.
