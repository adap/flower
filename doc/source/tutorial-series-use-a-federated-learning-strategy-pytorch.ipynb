If there is a server-side dataset that can be used for evaluation purposes, then that's great. We can evaluate the newly aggregated model after each round of training without having to send the model to clients. We're also fortunate in the sense that our entire evaluation dataset is available at all times.\n",

In fact, many scenarios require us to use **Federated Evaluation** if we want to get representative evaluation results at all. But this power comes at a cost: once we start to evaluate on the client side, we should be aware that our evaluation dataset can change over consecutive rounds of learning if those clients are not always available. Moreover, the dataset held by each client can also change over consecutive rounds. This can lead to evaluation results that are not stable, so even if we would not change the model, we'd see our evaluation results fluctuate over consecutive rounds.\n",

    "In some situations, we want to configure client-side execution (training, evaluation) from the server-side. One example for that is the server asking the clients to train for a certain number of local epochs. Flower provides a way to send configuration values from the server to the clients using a dictionary. Let's look at an example where the clients receive values from the server through the `config` parameter in `fit` (`config` is also available in `evaluate`). The `fit` method receives the configuration dictionary through the `config` parameter and can then read values from this dictionary. In this example, it reads `server_round` and `local_epochs` and uses those values to improve the logging and configure the number of local training epochs:"
