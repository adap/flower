Good First Contributions
========================

We welcome contributions to Flower! However, it is not always easy to know
where to start. We therefore put together a few recommendations on where to
start to increase your chances of getting your PR accepted into the Flower
codebase.


Where to Start
--------------

Until the Flower core library matures it will be easier to get PR's accepted if
they only touch non-core areas of the codebase. Good candidates to get started
are:

- Documentation: What's missing? What could be expressed more clearly? 
- Examples: See below.


Request for Examples
--------------------

We wish we had more time to write usage examples because we believe they help
users to get started with building what they want to build. Here are a few
ideas where we'd be happy to accept a PR:

- First scikit-learn example (MNIST)
- First MXNet 1.6 example (MNIST)
- ImageNet (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- LSTM (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Transformer (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- BERT (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
