Release Flower
==============

This document describes the current release process. It may or may not change in the future.

Before the release
------------------

Update the changelog (``changelog.md``) with all relevant changes that happened after the last release. If the last release was tagged ``v1.2.0``, you can use the following URL to see all commits that got merged into ``main`` since then:

`GitHub: Compare v1.2.0...main <https://github.com/adap/flower/compare/v1.2.0...main>`_

Thank the authors who contributed since the last release. This can be done by running the ``./dev/add-shortlog.sh`` convenience script (it can be ran multiple times and will update the names in the list if new contributors were added in the meantime).

During the release
------------------

The version number of a release is stated in ``pyproject.toml``. To release a new version of Flower, the following things need to happen (in that order):

1. Update the ``changelog.md`` section header ``Unreleased`` to contain the version number and date for the release you are building. Create a pull request with the change.
2. Tag the release commit with the version number as soon as the PR is merged: ``git tag v0.12.3``, then ``git push --tags``. This will create a draft release on GitHub containing the correct artifacts and the relevant part of the changelog.
3. Check the draft release on GitHub, and if everything is good, publish it.

After the release
-----------------

Create a pull request which contains the following changes:

1. Increase the minor version in ``pyproject.toml`` by one.
2. Update all files which contain the current version number if necessary.
3. Add a new ``Unreleased`` section in ``changelog.md``.

Merge the pull request on the same day (i.e., before a new nighly release gets published to PyPI).

Publishing a pre-release
------------------------

Pre-release naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyPI supports pre-releases (alpha, beta, release candiate). Pre-releases MUST use one of the following naming patterns:

- Alpha: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHaN``
- Beta: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHbN``
- Release candiate (RC): ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHrcN``

Examples include:

- ``1.0.0a0``
- ``1.0.0b0``
- ``1.0.0rc0``
- ``1.0.0rc1``

This is in line with PEP-440 and the recommendations from the Python Packaging
Authority (PyPA):

- `PEP-440 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/>`_
- `PyPA Choosing a versioning scheme <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#choosing-a-versioning-scheme>`_

Note that the approach defined by PyPA is not compatible with SemVer 2.0.0 spec, for details consult the `Semantic Versioning Specification <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-11>`_ (specifically item 11 on precedence).

Pre-release classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should the next pre-release be called alpha, beta, or release candidate?

- RC: feature complete, no known issues (apart from issues that are classified as "won't fix" for the next stable release) - if no issues surface this will become the next stable release
- Beta: feature complete, allowed to have known issues
- Alpha: not feature complete, allowed to have known issues
