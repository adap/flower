Good first contributions
========================

We welcome contributions to Flower! However, it is not always easy to know where to
start. We therefore put together a few recommendations on where to start to increase
your chances of getting your PR accepted into the Flower codebase.

Where to start
--------------

Until the Flower core library matures it will be easier to get PR's accepted if they
only touch non-core areas of the codebase. Good candidates to get started are:

- Documentation: What's missing? What could be expressed more clearly?
- Baselines: See below.
- Examples: See below.

Request for Flower Baselines
----------------------------

If you are not familiar with Flower Baselines, you should probably check-out our
`contributing guide for baselines
<https://flower.ai/docs/baselines/how-to-contribute-baselines.html>`_.

You should then check out the open `issues
<https://github.com/adap/flower/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+baseline%22>`_
for baseline requests. If you find a baseline that you'd like to work on and that has no
assignees, feel free to assign it to yourself and start working on it!

Otherwise, if you don't find a baseline you'd like to work on, be sure to open a new
issue with the baseline request template!

Request for examples
--------------------

We wish we had more time to write usage examples because we believe they help users to
get started with building what they want to build. Here are a few ideas where we'd be
happy to accept a PR:

- Llama 2 fine-tuning, with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch
- XGBoost
- Android ONNX on-device training
