# web-ts

You can use `npm` or `pnpm` (or probably `yarn`), but this README shows examples using `pnpm`

## Install

You can then install the project dependencies with:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Run

In order to run the project, you can use:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This should display a URL that you can navigate to on your browser to view the web-chat.

```{note}
You can also use `pnpm start` to perform the installation, build, and run steps at the same time.
```
