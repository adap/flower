# node-ts

You can use `npm` or `pnpm` (or probably `yarn`), but this README shows examples using `pnpm`

## Install

You can then install the project dependencies with:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Build

If you want to build the project, you can use:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Run

In order to run the example once the project has been built:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

```{note}
You can also use `pnpm start` to perform the installation, build, and run steps at the same time.
```
