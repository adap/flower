Use Flower Confidential Remote Compute
======================================

To use Flower Confidential Remote Compute you must first subscribe from the `Flower
Intelligence page <https://flower.ai/intelligence>`_.

Obtain your API key
-------------------

Once you are connected and have a valid subscription, you can navigate to the `Projects
page <https://flower.ai/intelligence/projects>`_.

On this page, you can manage your compute projects, API keys, and secure access to the
Flower Intelligence platform. The following steps guide you through the complete setup
process:

1. **Access the Projects Dashboard**

   After logging in, you’ll land on the **Projects Dashboard**, which lists all your
   existing projects. If this is your first time using the service, the list will be
   empty.

2. **Create a New Project**

   Click on **New Project** to create your first compute project. Each project
   represents a logical environment where you can manage API keys and access compute
   resources.

   Enter a descriptive name for your project (e.g., “Mobile App” or “Research
   Deployment”) and click **Create**.

3. **View Your Project Dashboard**

   The project dashboard provides an overview of your project, including API key
   management, usage statistics, and configuration options.

4. **Create a Management API Key**

   Before you can generate regular API keys, you must create a **Management API Key**.
   This special key allows you to manage and rotate other keys. Click **Management API
   Key** and follow the instructions.

5. **Save the Management Key**

   Once the key is created, copy it and store it securely. **Important:** This is the
   only time you’ll be able to view the full key value. If lost, you will need to create
   a new one.

6. **Access the API Keys Dashboard**

   With a management key in place, you can now create standard API keys for your
   applications. Navigate to the **API Keys** section.

7. **Create a New API Key**

   Click **+ API Key** and configure its parameters, including token limit and optional
   search limit. These limits help control usage and costs.

8. **Copy and Store Your API Key**

   After creation, copy the API key immediately. As with the management key, you won’t
   be able to view it again later. Use this key in your client applications to
   authenticate with Flower Intelligence services.

9. **Confirm Your Key is Active**

   Your new key will now appear in the dashboard. You can edit its metadata, revoke it,
   or create additional keys as needed.

Use your API key
----------------

Once all of this is done, you can use your API key in your application code to enable
Flower Confidential Remote Compute.

TypeScript we have available on our `GitHub repo <https://github.com/adap/flower>`_.
